name: daily-seo-content
description: Daily SEO blog ship for rohitraj.tech. Scans existing slugs, finds competitor SERP gap, drafts + writes a Zod-valid BlogPost, generates an SEO-optimized AI cover image via Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro), registers in index.ts + llms.txt, typechecks, builds, commits, pushes, and triggers Vercel prod deploy via CLI. Use when user says "daily seo", "ship today's blog", or runs `/daily-seo-content`.

# Daily SEO Content Sprint

End-to-end one-command blog ship. Scans gap, writes post, deploys.

## Args (optional)

- `--keyword "X"` — override auto-pick, force topic
- `--service-link "/en/services/Y"` — override CTA target (default: `/en/services/6-week-mvp`)
- `--dry-run` — outline only, no write/commit/deploy
- `--no-deploy` — write + commit + push but skip Vercel deploy
- `--no-image` — skip AI cover image generation (post ships without coverImage)
- `--image-style "X"` — override cover style prompt (default: tech editorial dark gradient)

## Skill Orchestration (auto-pipeline, 2026-05-10 update)

Daily skill is the **conductor**. It orchestrates 8 sub-skills + 4 cron-driven sister skills. Findings from 2026-05-10 SEO research drove this redesign — Google March 2026 core update penalizes "scaled content abuse" 60-90%, and 44.2% of AI Overview citations come from the first 30% of text.

### One-time setup (run BEFORE next daily ship)

| Step | Skill | Purpose | Block daily until done? |
|------|-------|---------|--------------------------|
| 0.1 | `/seo-audit` | Full-site baseline health score (parallel agents) | No |
| 0.2 | `/seo-google` | Diagnose 0/83 indexation (memory 13613) — fix sitemap/robots/CWV | YES — current daily run is wasted while indexation broken |
| 0.3 | `/seo-schema` | Add credentialed `Person` schema with `jobTitle`, `knowsAbout[]`, `sameAs[]`, `alumniOf` to `src/lib/seo-config.ts` | YES — without credentialed author, AI engines deprioritize entirely |
| 0.4 | `/seo-plan` | Roll audit findings into 30-day roadmap, write to `~/wiki/wiki/seo-performance-tracker.md` | No |

### Per-post sub-skills (called inline by daily pipeline)

| Daily Step | Sub-skill | Mode | Failure = block? |
|------------|-----------|------|------------------|
| 2 | `/seo-dataforseo` | REPLACES WebSearch — live SERP volume + competition + AI visibility for keyword pick | No (fall through to WebSearch if MCP not configured) |
| 2.5 | `/seo-firecrawl` | Scrape top-5 ranking pages for chosen keyword. Extract H2 list + word count + schema. Outline matches | No (degrade to manual outline) |
| 4a | TL;DR injection | Section 0 = 60-100 word inverted-pyramid summary. Direct answer line 1 / cost or comparison line 2 / when-to-skip line 3. Captures 44.2% AI-citation window | YES |
| 4a | Author byline | Under H1: "By Rohit Raj — Founding Engineer, 10+ yrs MVP shipping" + link to `/about` + LinkedIn. Renders into BlogPosting.author Person schema | YES |
| 6.5 | `/seo-sitemap` | Validate XML sitemap includes new URL, no orphan, hreflang correct | YES (dies if sitemap broken — 0/83 won't improve) |
| 7.5a | `/seo-schema` | Validate JSON-LD on built page. BlogPosting must have `author`, `datePublished`, `image`, `headline`, `mainEntityOfPage`, `publisher` | YES |
| 7.5b | `/seo-content` | E-E-A-T scan + thin-content + scaled-AI-pattern detection. **Hard gates:** ≥1 concrete number per claim section, ≥1 named example, intro variance check vs last 5 posts | YES |
| 7.5c | `/seo-geo` | Passage-level citability for AI Overviews / ChatGPT / Perplexity. TL;DR must be extractable as standalone answer | YES |

**All three Step 7.5 gates fire in PARALLEL** (single message, 3 Agent tool calls). All must pass before commit.
| 11.5a | `/seo-google` | URL Inspection + Indexing API ping for the new URL | No |
| 11.5b | `/seo-page` | Post-deploy single-URL deep audit. Score logged to wiki tracker | No |
| 11.5c | `/seo-backlinks` | **MANDATORY** — verify 5 crosspost referrers register, track new/lost domains, anchor drift, toxic flags | YES — surface if 0/5 crossposts register after 7d |

**All three fire in PARALLEL** (single message, 3 Agent tool calls).

### Weekly cron — sister skills (separate `/loop 7d` or `/schedule weekly`)

| Skill | Why | Output |
|-------|-----|--------|
| `/seo-technical` | Crawl + index + CWV + JS render check | Append findings to wiki tracker |
| `/seo-backlinks` | **Also runs per-post (Step 11.5c).** Weekly = full referring-domain sweep + competitor link gap | Append to wiki tracker |
| `/seo-competitor-pages` | Track competitors targeting same keywords | Append to wiki tracker |

### Monthly cron

| Skill | Why |
|-------|-----|
| `/seo-audit` | Fresh baseline. Compare to prior month |
| `/seo-plan` | Re-prioritize 30-day roadmap |

### Living performance tracker

`~/wiki/wiki/seo-performance-tracker.md` — append-only learnings from Google + AI search engines + algorithm updates. Read at start of each daily run to honor latest known constraints. Update with new findings, ranking shifts, AI-Overview citation trends, algo update reactions.

### Anti-scaled-content guards (March 2026 core update reaction)

Hard gates enforced by `/seo-content` in Step 7.5b:

1. Each "claim" section (sections 2-4 of outline) MUST contain ≥1 concrete number from your real projects (PropCheck scrape stats, MyFinancial usage, real client cost). No generic stats.
2. Each post MUST contain ≥1 named example (real client, real project, real bug you hit).
3. Intro variance: cosine similarity of first 200 chars vs last 5 posts MUST be < 0.85. Block if too templated.
4. Schema authority: BlogPosting.author MUST resolve to credentialed Person (not just name string).
5. Cadence soft cap: do not ship more than 4 posts per 7 days. (Daily ship was the pre-March-2026 strategy. Now: depth > velocity.)

### Crosspost reconsider (canonical flip)

Google flipped canonical-for-syndication recommendation in 2026 — now prefers `noindex` on syndicate. Steps 13-17 keep firing for **discoverability traffic**, NOT counted as SEO backlink. Wayback + GitHub-index = vanity DR (high-DR + zero-traffic = neutralized 2026). Investigate `noindex` toggle on dev.to + Hashnode where supported.

---

## Environment

Project: `/home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai`
Node: v22 via fnm (NEVER `/usr/bin/node` v12)

```bash
export PATH="$(ls -td /run/user/1001/fnm_multishells/*/bin | head -1):$PATH"
```

Confirm with `node --version` → must show `v22.x`.

## CRITICAL: Vercel is NOT auto-deploy on push

Pushing to main does NOT deploy to production for nexusai. Deploy is CLI-triggered only. Skill MUST run `npx vercel --prod --yes` after push, or invoke `/deploy-site` skill. Never claim "Vercel auto-deploys" — the user has corrected this.

## Step 1: Read state (avoid dupes)

```bash
cd /home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai
ls src/data/posts/*.ts | grep -v index.ts
```

Also read:
- `src/data/services.ts` — list of service slugs (CTA targets)
- `public/llms.txt` — current registered post URLs
- `src/types/blog.ts` — Zod schema for BlogPost (must be valid)

Build set of existing slugs. New post slug MUST NOT collide.

## Step 2: Competitor SERP scan (PREFER `/seo-dataforseo`, fall through to WebSearch)

**FIRST try sub-skill** `/seo-dataforseo` for live SERP volume + competition + AI-visibility on each candidate keyword. $0.0006/call, real Google data. If MCP not configured, fall through to WebSearch.

Run 3-5 queries from this rotation (pick 3 not used in last 7 days; track in `.claude/skills/daily-seo-content/.history.json` if needed):

- `hire founding engineer India 2026`
- `fractional CTO startup MVP India`
- `freelance MVP developer India cost`
- `Lovable alternative when AI builder breaks`
- `Bolt new vs hire developer 2026`
- `startup tech stack 2026 MVP`
- `hire technical co-founder India`
- `MVP development cost India 2026`
- `vibe coding production bugs`
- `Next.js Postgres MVP stack 2026`
- `hire React Native developer India`
- `Spring Boot MVP backend 2026`
- `WhatsApp business API integration India`
- `Supabase RLS production bugs`
- `hire AI engineer India MVP`

For each query, capture: top 5 ranking URLs + their angle. Find a sub-angle NOT covered on rohitraj.tech.

## Step 3: Pick winning keyword

Score candidates by:

1. **Coverage gap** — keyword must NOT match any existing slug or close synonym
2. **Search intent** — high-intent ("hire X", "X cost", "X vs Y") beats informational
3. **Exact-match URL fit** — slug should be 4-7 hyphenated words including target keyword
4. **Link target fit** — must naturally CTA to `/services/6-week-mvp` or `/services/hire-founding-engineer-india`
5. **Freshness** — prefer 2026-dated comparisons over evergreen generic

Pick highest-scoring candidate. Print scoring rationale (3 sentences) before writing.

## Step 3.5: Scrape top-5 SERP via `/seo-firecrawl` (NEW)

Call sub-skill `/seo-firecrawl` to scrape top-5 ranking URLs for the chosen keyword. Extract:

- Their H2/H3 list
- Total word count (target ±20% of their average)
- Schema blocks present (BlogPosting, FAQPage, HowTo, etc.)
- Author byline + credential pattern
- TL;DR / summary block presence

Use this to inform outline matching in Step 4. Failure here = degrade to manual outline, do not block.

## Step 4: Draft outline

6-8 sections following this structure. **Section 0 (NEW, MANDATORY)** = explicit `## TL;DR` block, 60-100 words, before H1-restated intro. Captures the 44.2% AI-citation window per Position Digital 2026 data.

0. **`## TL;DR`** (NEW) — 60-100 words, inverted pyramid: direct answer in line 1, cost/comparison in line 2, when-to-skip-this-approach in line 3. MUST be standalone-extractable as an AI Overview snippet.

   **Author byline (NEW, MANDATORY)** — under H1, before TL;DR: `By [Rohit Raj](/about) — Founding Engineer · 10+ yrs MVP shipping · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitraj2/)`. NO `**bold**` wrap around byline — renderer's non-greedy `\*\*.*?\*\*` regex swallows nested links inside bold. Renders into `BlogPosting.author` Person schema with credentials.

1. **H2 = title restated** — 3-paragraph intro with the answer in line 1, the cost/comparison in line 2, the structural reason in line 3
2. **H2 = first concrete claim** — 200-300 words, table or bulleted list
3. **H2 = second concrete claim** — 200-300 words
4. **H2 = third concrete claim** — 200-300 words
5. **H2 = side-by-side / comparison** — markdown table (SEO + AI-citation benefit)
6. **H2 = when the alternative wins** — honest counter-position (E-E-A-T signal)
7. **H2 = decision tree / actionable takeaway** — 5-step checklist or rules
8. **CTA section** — link to `/en/services/6-week-mvp` AND `/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india`

Word count target: 1500-2200 words total.

## Step 4b: Generate SEO cover image (provider cascade — image is REQUIRED)

Skip ONLY if `--no-image` arg passed. Otherwise every post MUST have a cover image. The cascade below guarantees one — no provider failure can leave the post without a cover.

### Why a cover image (always)
- Renders at top of post (`src/app/[locale]/notes/[slug]/page.tsx` reads `post.coverImage`)
- Wired into JSON-LD `BlogPosting.image` (`src/lib/seo-config.ts:438`) — Google needs this for Article rich results + AI Overviews
- Used as OG/Twitter card preview (so social shares look pro and CTR lifts)
- Posts without images rank lower and get skipped by AI Overviews — never ship without one

### Provider cascade (fall through on any failure)

| # | Provider | Cost | Key needed | Why |
|---|----------|------|------------|-----|
| 1 | **Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro)** | Paid | `GEMINI_API_KEY` from `~/.claude/settings.json` | Best quality, on-brand prompts |
| 2 | **Pollinations.ai (rotated model)** | Free | None | No-auth public API. Script rotates between `flux`, `flux-realism`, `flux-3d`, `turbo` so daily output looks different |
| 3 | **Stable Horde (community SD)** | Free | None | Crowd-hosted Stable Diffusion / SDXL, anonymous queue. Different visual style than Flux — adds variety when Pollinations style gets stale |
| 4 | **Hugging Face Inference (FLUX.1-schnell)** | Free tier | `HF_TOKEN` (optional) | Fast schnell variant; works without token at lower priority |
| 5 | **Deterministic SVG/PIL fallback** | Free | None | Title-on-gradient image. Always succeeds. Last-resort guarantee. |

Try in order. First success wins. The script below handles all five in one file.

### Daily variety guarantee

Same blog cover style every day = "AI slop" pattern recognition for readers. Script enforces variety via four randomized axes per run:

1. **Visual metaphor** — picked at random from a pool of ~15 metaphors (cracked circuit, neural lattice, topographic contours, particle swarm, holographic blocks, glowing fractured monolith, code-rain, glitched stream, prism shatter, etc.). NOT always "two pillars".
2. **Accent palette** — random pick from 6 palettes (teal+violet, cyan+magenta, lime+electric-blue, orange+indigo, pink+emerald, amber+crimson).
3. **Pollinations model** — round-robin between `flux`, `flux-realism`, `flux-3d`, `turbo`. Each renders the same prompt with a different aesthetic.
4. **Random seed** — time-based, NOT slug-deterministic. Re-running on same slug yields a fresh image.

### SEO image rules

| Rule | Value | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Aspect | `16:9` (1280x720 min, prefer 1920x1080) | Matches renderer's 800x450 box + best for OG cards (Twitter/LinkedIn/FB all favor 1.91:1, 16:9 close enough) |
| Format | JPEG (`.jpg`) | Smallest size at quality 82; Next/Image converts to AVIF/WebP at runtime |
| Filename | `<slug>-cover.jpg` | Slug already = SEO keyword phrase (kebab-case). Filename is itself a ranking signal |
| Path | `public/images/notes/<slug>-cover.jpg` | Matches existing dir convention (see `bedrock-vs-openai-flow.png`) |
| File size | < 400KB target | Compress with PIL (quality 82, progressive) if larger |
| Text in image | NONE (Gemini/Pollinations/HF). Title text ALLOWED only in SVG fallback (when AI providers all fail) | Avoid OCR confusion, i18n breaks; fallback SVG is acceptable when nothing else works |
| Style | Tech editorial, dark gradient, abstract | Matches site's dark/minimal vibe. NO clipart, NO stock-photo people |
| Alt text | 8-15 words, includes primary keyword + describes scene | Google + screen readers; ≤125 chars hard cap |

### Prompt construction (script handles randomization internally)

Caller passes the slug + topic phrase + title. The script picks a random metaphor + palette + model + seed and constructs the final prompt — caller does NOT pre-build the prompt anymore.

The metaphor pool, palette pool, and model rotation live inside `gen_cover.py` (see Generation script below). To bias toward a specific metaphor for one post, pass `--style "<metaphor phrase>"` as a 4th arg; otherwise random.

Final prompt template the script fills internally:

```
Editorial blog cover, 16:9, dark theme. {random_metaphor} suggesting {topic_phrase}.
{random_palette_clause}, deep navy or near-black background, soft volumetric lighting,
subtle grid or grain texture. {random_render_style}, shallow depth of field.
NO text, NO letters, NO logos, NO human faces, NO stock-photo cliches.
Composition: rule of thirds, hero element off-center, clean negative space for OG card crop.
```

### Generation script (cascade)

One-time setup (idempotent):
```bash
pip install --user google-genai pillow requests 2>/dev/null
```

Write this to `/tmp/gen_cover.py` (overwrite each run, never commit):

```python

import io, json, requests

Run:

```bash
cd /home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai
# Args: slug, topic-phrase (short), title, [optional forced-metaphor]
python3 /tmp/gen_cover.py "<slug>" "<topic phrase>" "<post title>"
# Force a specific metaphor (skips random pick):
python3 /tmp/gen_cover.py "<slug>" "<topic phrase>" "<post title>" "cracked monolith with glowing fissures"
```

Each run prints the metaphor / palette / render style / seed it picked, then the provider that won. Re-running on the same slug yields a different image because seed and metaphor are random per run, not derived from the slug.

### Verify

```bash
file public/images/notes/<slug>-cover.jpg     # must say "JPEG image data"
python3 -c "from PIL import Image; im=Image.open('public/images/notes/<slug>-cover.jpg'); print(im.size, im.format)"
ls -lh public/images/notes/<slug>-cover.jpg
```

Expect: `(1920, 1080) JPEG`, file < 400KB.

### Alt text rules

Construct alt text as: `<scene description> illustrating <primary keyword>`. Examples:
- `Two glowing teal pillars on a dark grid illustrating AWS Bedrock vs OpenAI cost comparison`
- `Six abstract sprint blocks rising in arc illustrating 6-week MVP development timeline India 2026`

Hard cap 125 chars. Lowercase first letter is fine; do NOT keyword-stuff.

### Provider failure handling

The cascade is the failure handling — there is no "skip image" branch. If provider 4 (deterministic fallback) ever fails to produce a valid file, the skill MUST stop and surface the error to the user (image is required for SEO/OG). In practice provider 4 cannot fail — it's pure local PIL with no network or auth.

## Step 5: Write BlogPost TS file

Filename: `src/data/posts/<slug>.ts`

Schema (validated by `src/types/blog.ts`):

```typescript
import type { BlogPost } from '@/types/blog';

export const camelCaseExportName: BlogPost = {
  slug: 'kebab-case-slug',
  title: 'Title with target keyword + 2026',
  date: 'YYYY-MM-DD', // today, format \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}
  excerpt: '1-2 sentence hook with primary keyword',
  readingTime: 'N min read',
  keywords: [
    'primary keyword',
    'secondary keyword',
    '5-7 total keywords',
  ],
  relatedProject: 'myFinancial', // optional, pick from existing projects
  coverImage: { // OMIT if --no-image was passed or generation failed
    src: '/images/notes/<slug>-cover.jpg',
    alt: '8-15 word scene description with primary keyword, ≤125 chars',
  },
  sections: [
    { heading: 'H2 text', content: 'Markdown body...' },
    // 6-8 sections
  ],
  cta: {
    text: 'CTA button text',
    href: '/en/services/6-week-mvp',
  },
};
```

Rules:
- `date` MUST be today's date (UTC). Get via `date -u +%Y-%m-%d`.
- `slug` MUST be kebab-case, ≤ 60 chars, no underscores, no leading hyphen.
- `keywords` array: 5-8 entries, lowercase.
- Each section's `content` is plain markdown (paragraphs, lists, tables). Tables use pipe-syntax.
- Internal links use `[text](https://rohitraj.tech/en/...)` or relative `[text](/en/...)`.
- At least 2 internal links to `/en/services/*` per post.
- Bold via `**text**`, code via backticks. NO `<br>` or HTML tags.

## Step 6: Register

Edit `src/data/posts/index.ts`:

1. Add `import { camelCaseExportName } from './<slug>';` near other imports (alphabetical or end of import block)
2. Add `camelCaseExportName,` to the `allPosts` array (end of array, before closing `]`)

Edit `public/llms.txt`:

1. Add line under "All Engineering Notes" section: `- [Title](https://rohitraj.tech/en/notes/<slug>)`
2. Increment post count in heading if present (e.g. "34 posts" → "35 posts")

## Step 6.5: Validate sitemap via `/seo-sitemap` (NEW)

Call sub-skill `/seo-sitemap`. Confirms new URL is in XML sitemap, no orphan, hreflang tags correct, no broken entries. **Hard gate** — if sitemap is broken, fixing 0/83 indexation is impossible. Block ship until pass.

## Step 7: Typecheck + build

```bash
export PATH="$(ls -td /run/user/1001/fnm_multishells/*/bin | head -1):$PATH"
cd /home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```

If typecheck fails: STOP. Read error, fix the post file, retry. Do NOT commit broken code.
If build fails: STOP. Read error, fix, retry.
If both pass: proceed to gates.

## Step 7.5: Pre-commit quality gates (NEW — block on fail, RUN IN PARALLEL)

Three sub-skills MUST run in **parallel** (single message, multiple Agent tool calls). ALL must pass before commit. Sequential = wasted minutes per post.

```
Agent[seo-schema]   ← validates JSON-LD     ┐
Agent[seo-content]  ← E-E-A-T + scaled-AI   ├─ all 3 fire simultaneously
Agent[seo-geo]      ← AI Overview citability ┘
```

Wait for ALL 3 results. Block commit if any fails.

### 7.5a — `/seo-schema` validate JSON-LD

Required on built page:
- `BlogPosting` with `headline`, `datePublished`, `dateModified`, `image`, `mainEntityOfPage`, `publisher`
- `BlogPosting.author` resolves to credentialed `Person` (not just name) — `jobTitle`, `description`, `sameAs[]`
- `BreadcrumbList` for `/en/notes/<slug>`
- No JSON-LD parse errors

Block commit if any required field missing.

### 7.5b — `/seo-content` E-E-A-T + anti-scaled-content

Hard gates:
1. ≥1 concrete number per claim section (real PropCheck/MyFinancial/client number, NOT generic stat)
2. ≥1 named example (real client / project / bug)
3. Intro variance: cosine similarity of first 200 chars vs last 5 posts < 0.85
4. Word count 1500-2200 (±20% of top-5 SERP from Step 3.5)
5. Reading level: Grade 8-12 (Flesch-Kincaid)
6. ≥2 internal `/en/services/*` links

Block commit if any hard gate fails.

### 7.5c — `/seo-geo` AI Overview citability

Pass criteria:
- TL;DR block (Section 0) is standalone-extractable as direct answer (60-100 words, no orphan references)
- ≥3 H2 headings phrased as natural-language questions (matches user query patterns)
- Comparison table present (Section 5) — AI engines cite tables 2.3x more than prose

Block commit if TL;DR is not extractable.

If all 3 gates pass: proceed to Step 8 commit.

## Step 8: Commit

Stage ONLY the new + modified files (never `git add -A`):

```bash
git add src/data/posts/<slug>.ts src/data/posts/index.ts public/llms.txt public/images/notes/<slug>-cover.jpg
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(seo): daily post — <slug>

Targets: <primary keyword>, <secondary keyword>
Internal links: /en/services/6-week-mvp, /en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india
Cover image: AI-generated via <provider>, 1920x1080 JPEG (<filesize>KB)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

## Step 9: Push to main

```bash
git push origin main
```

If push fails (auth, conflict): STOP and report to user.

## Step 10: Vercel production deploy (CLI — NOT auto)

Pushing to main does NOT deploy. Run CLI explicitly:

```bash
export PATH="$(ls -td /run/user/1001/fnm_multishells/*/bin | head -1):$PATH"
cd /home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai
npx vercel --prod --yes
```

Capture the deployment URL printed by CLI.

If `--no-deploy` arg was passed, skip this step and tell user "post pushed, deploy skipped — run /deploy-site to ship".

If Vercel CLI prompts for login or token: STOP and tell user. Never auto-authenticate.

## Step 11: Verify deploy

```bash
sleep 30
curl -sI https://rohitraj.tech/en/notes/<slug> | head -5
```

If HTTP 200, proceed to Step 11.5. If 404, wait another 60s and retry.

## Step 11.5: Post-deploy audit (NEW — RUN IN PARALLEL, 3 sub-skills)

**RUN IN PARALLEL** — single message, three Agent tool calls. Waste no minutes serially.

```
Agent[seo-google]    ← URL Inspection + Indexing API  ┐
Agent[seo-page]      ← deep single-URL audit          ├─ all 3 fire simultaneously
Agent[seo-backlinks] ← MANDATORY backlink ping check  ┘
```

### 11.5a — `/seo-google` URL Inspection + Indexing API

Calls Google URL Inspection API on the new URL. Confirms:
- URL is crawlable
- Mobile-friendly
- Schema valid in Google's eyes
- No coverage issues

Then fires Indexing API ping (`/seo-google` handles auth via service account at `~/.config/gsc/indexing-sa.json`). Replaces manual Step 12 GSC link click for the Google leg (IndexNow still fires for Bing/Yandex in Step 12).

### 11.5b — `/seo-page` deep audit

Run sub-skill on the live URL. Captures:
- On-page score
- Schema validity
- Image optimization
- Internal-link count
- Word count vs SERP top-5
- TTFB, LCP, INP from real fetch

Append result to `~/wiki/wiki/seo-performance-tracker.md` under "Per-post audit log" section.

### 11.5c — `/seo-backlinks` MANDATORY (NEW — fires every post-publish)

**Why mandatory:** every published page is a potential backlink anchor. Crosspost steps 13-17 produce 5 backlinks per post; we need to verify they actually register and that their referring-domain quality didn't degrade since last week.

Sub-skill checks:
- New referring domains since last run (delta count)
- The 5 expected crosspost referrers (dev.to, Hashnode, Wayback, Bluesky, GitHub blog-index) — confirm at least 3 register within 7 days
- Anchor text distribution drift
- Toxic link flagged this week
- Lost links since last run

Append result to `~/wiki/wiki/seo-performance-tracker.md` under "Backlink Health (weekly)" + "Per-post audit log" sections.

**Failure mode:** if 0 of 5 crosspost referrers register after 7 days, surface to user — likely the crosspost script broke or canonical-flip 2026 rule is dropping them. Do not auto-disable crossposting — investigate first.

## Step 12: Submit for indexing (IndexNow + Google Indexing API)

Pings Bing/Yandex/ChatGPT-web-search via IndexNow (always works) + Google Indexing API (when service account configured at `~/.config/gsc/indexing-sa.json`).

```bash
cd /home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai
./scripts/submit-seo.sh "https://rohitraj.tech/en/notes/<slug>"
```

Expected output:
- `IndexNow → api.indexnow.org`: HTTP 200 or 202
- `IndexNow → Bing mirror`: HTTP 200
- `IndexNow → Yandex mirror`: HTTP 200 or 202
- `Google Indexing API`: HTTP 200 (if SA configured) OR `SKIPPED` (if not, falls back to printing GSC URL Inspector deep-link for manual click)

If Google Indexing API is skipped: copy the printed GSC deep-link, open in browser, click "Request Indexing" once. One-time GCP setup at `docs/google-indexing-setup.md`.

Failures here are non-fatal — post is already live, this is just acceleration. Log results but do not retry on individual failures (IndexNow rate-limits at 10K URLs/day; we use < 5).

## Step 13: Cross-post to dev.to (dofollow backlink)

Cross-posts the new article to dev.to with `canonical_url` pointing back to rohitraj.tech.
dev.to honors `canonical_url` → no SEO duplicate-content penalty + dofollow attribution backlink from DR ~88 site.

```bash
cd /home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai
python3 scripts/devto-publish.py --slug "<slug>"
```

Requires `DEV_TO_API_KEY` env var. Get key at https://dev.to/settings/extensions.
Persist via `~/.config/fish/config.fish`: `set -gx DEV_TO_API_KEY "..."`

Script reads title/excerpt/keywords directly from `src/data/posts/<slug>.ts` — no manual config per post.
Tags auto-derived by `scripts/crosspost_tags.py`: the post's keywords + title are matched against a topic-signal table and mapped onto a curated allowlist of **real dev.to tags** (`ai` always included, max 4). Off-allowlist candidates are rejected — never emitted as raw keyword fragments. Override with `--tags a,b,c,d`; override values are allowlist-checked too.

To retag an article that is already live (in-place `PUT /articles/{id}`, never creates a duplicate):

```bash
python3 scripts/devto-publish.py --slug "<slug>" --fix-tags
```

Rate limit: dev.to allows 9 articles per 30s. Script auto-retries once on 429 with 90s backoff.

Failures here are non-fatal — main post is already live + indexed. Log result and continue.

Skip this step if:
- `DEV_TO_API_KEY` not set (print one-time setup instructions, do not block)
- `--no-deploy` arg was passed (post not live yet, can't backlink)

## Step 14: Cross-post to Hashnode (dofollow backlink)

Hashnode honors `originalArticleURL` (canonical) → no dup-content penalty + dofollow attribution from DR ~73.

```bash
cd /home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai
python3 scripts/hashnode-publish.py --slug "<slug>"
```

Requires:
- `HASHNODE_API_KEY` — https://hashnode.com/settings/developer
- `HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID` — GraphQL: `{ me { publications(first:1){ edges{ node{ id } } } } }`

Persist via `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:
```fish
set -gx HASHNODE_API_KEY "..."
set -gx HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID "..."
```

Tags auto-derived by `scripts/crosspost_tags.py` (same topic-signal table as dev.to, mapped to Hashnode slugs, max 5). Hashnode silently creates unknown tag slugs, so the allowlist is what stops dead tags like `ai-model-price-war-august-2026`. Override with `--tags a,b,c`; override values are allowlist-checked too.

Failures non-fatal. Skip if env not set or `--no-deploy` passed.

## Step 15: Wayback Machine snapshot (DR 93 backlink + permanent archive)

Submits live URL to archive.org for permanent snapshot. No auth required. Adds DR ~93 backlink + preserves canonical version against future drift.

```bash
cd /home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai
python3 scripts/wayback-save.py --slug "<slug>"
```

Optional `WAYBACK_S3_KEY` + `WAYBACK_S3_SECRET` for higher rate limit (https://archive.org/account/s3.php).

Failures non-fatal. Skip if `--no-deploy`. Rate limit ~15/min unsigned.

## Step 16: Bluesky announcement (atproto, indexed)

Posts blog announcement to Bluesky. Open protocol, indexed by Google, dofollow on most viewers.

```bash
cd /home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai
python3 scripts/bluesky-post.py --slug "<slug>"
```

Requires:
- `BLUESKY_HANDLE` (e.g., `rohitraj.bsky.social`)
- `BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD` — https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords (NOT main password)

Persist via `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:
```fish
set -gx BLUESKY_HANDLE "rohitraj.bsky.social"
set -gx BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

Auto-truncates to 300 chars + adds rich-text link facet. Failures non-fatal.

## Step 17: GitHub blog index (DR 100 dofollow)

Appends entry to a public GitHub README repo. GitHub READMEs render with dofollow links → DR ~100 backlink per post.

One-time setup:
1. Create public repo: `github.com/rohitguta2432/blog-index`
2. Init `README.md` containing the marker line: `<!-- BLOG_INDEX_START -->`
3. Default repo hardcoded as `rohitguta2432/blog-index` — override only via `GITHUB_BLOG_INDEX_REPO` env if needed

```bash
cd /home/t0266li/Documents/nexusai
python3 scripts/github-blog-index.py --slug "<slug>"
```

Requires `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`). Idempotent — skips if URL already in README.

Failures non-fatal. Skip if env not set or `--no-deploy`.

## Step 18: Report

Report to user:

- New post slug + title
- Live URL: `https://rohitraj.tech/en/notes/<slug>`
- Vercel deployment URL (from CLI)
- Target keywords
- Internal-link count
- HTTP status from curl check
- IndexNow status (Bing + Yandex)
- Google Indexing API status (200 / skipped / GSC link printed)
- dev.to crosspost URL (or "skipped — DEV_TO_API_KEY not set")
- Hashnode crosspost URL (or "skipped — HASHNODE_API_KEY not set")
- Wayback snapshot URL (or "skipped/rate-limited")
- Bluesky post URL (or "skipped — BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD not set")
- GitHub index commit (or "skipped — GITHUB_BLOG_INDEX_REPO not set")
- Total time (start to deploy)

## Guardrails

- NEVER skip dupe check (slug collision = build error or 404)
- NEVER push if typecheck or build fails
- NEVER claim "Vercel auto-deploys" — it does not for this project
- NEVER `git add -A` (catches secrets, .env, .vercel)
- NEVER `--no-verify` or `--force` push
- NEVER write a post longer than 2500 words (Google cuts off, AI Overviews skip)
- NEVER write a post shorter than 1200 words (thin content)
- NEVER repeat a competitor angle already covered (check existing slugs first)
- ALWAYS run typecheck + build BEFORE commit
- ALWAYS run `vercel --prod` after push (manual deploy is the rule)
- ALWAYS produce a cover image — cascade through Gemini → Pollinations → HuggingFace → SVG/PIL fallback. Image is required for SEO and OG cards. Only `--no-image` arg can suppress.
- NEVER commit `/tmp/gen_cover.py` (kept out of repo; recreated each run)

## Failure modes + recovery

| Failure | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| Slug collision | Append `-2026` or rephrase keyword, retry |
| Typecheck error | Read error, fix BlogPost shape, retry |
| Build error | Read error, fix import or content, retry |
| Push rejected | `git pull --rebase origin main`, retry |
| Vercel CLI not found | `npm i -g vercel` then retry |
| Vercel auth prompt | Stop, tell user to `vercel login` |
| Curl returns 404 post-deploy | Wait 60s, retry; deploy may still propagate |
| Gemini image gen errors | Cascade auto-falls to Pollinations (free) — no action needed |
| Pollinations timeout/5xx | Cascade auto-falls to HuggingFace FLUX.1-schnell |
| HuggingFace 503 model warming | Script retries 3x with 8s sleep; then falls to SVG/PIL fallback |
| All AI providers down | SVG/PIL fallback runs locally — produces title-on-gradient image; never fails |
| `python3 -c "from PIL import Image"` errors | `pip install --user pillow requests google-genai` then retry |
| Image > 400KB after compress | Re-run with quality=70 in `save_jpeg`, or accept and ship (still under Google's 5MB limit) |
| IndexNow returns 422 | Key file not yet deployed at `/<key>.txt` — wait for Vercel propagation, retry |
| Google Indexing API 403 | Service account not Owner in GSC — see `docs/google-indexing-setup.md` step 5 |
| Google Indexing API 401 | JWT signature invalid — check system clock with `timedatectl status` |
| `cryptography` module missing | `pip install --user cryptography` (needed for SA JWT signing) |
| dev.to 429 rate-limited | Script auto-retries once after 90s; if still fails, run manually later: `python3 scripts/devto-publish.py --slug <slug>` |
| dev.to 401 unauthorized | `DEV_TO_API_KEY` invalid — regenerate at https://dev.to/settings/extensions |
| dev.to 422 invalid tags | dev.to rejected auto-derived tags — rerun with `--tags java,ai,backend,api` |
| Hashnode missing publicationId | Run GraphQL `{ me { publications(first:1){ edges{ node{ id } } } } }` at https://gql.hashnode.com/, set `HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID` |
| Hashnode 401 | API key invalid — regenerate at https://hashnode.com/settings/developer |
| Wayback 429 | Rate-limited — retry later or set `WAYBACK_S3_KEY`/`WAYBACK_S3_SECRET` for higher limits |
| Bluesky 401 | App password invalid — regenerate at https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords (do NOT use main pw) |
| Bluesky text > 300 chars | Script auto-truncates excerpt; if title alone exceeds, shorten title |
| GitHub blog-index marker missing | Add `<!-- BLOG_INDEX_START -->` line to README.md in the index repo, retry |
| GitHub blog-index push fails | Run `gh auth status` — re-auth if needed |

## Daily cadence (REVISED 2026-05-10)

**Old:** `/loop 24h /daily-seo-content` for daily ship.
**New:** Soft cap 4 posts / 7 days (March 2026 anti-scaled-content rule). Use `/loop 42h /daily-seo-content` (= 4/week) or `/schedule` 3 days/week.

For manual run: just invoke `/daily-seo-content`.

## Sister-skill cron (separate scheduling)

Weekly (`/loop 7d` each):
- `/seo-technical` — crawl/index/CWV/JS render
- `/seo-backlinks` — referring domains drift, toxic link detection
- `/seo-competitor-pages` — competitor SERP movement

Monthly:
- `/seo-audit` — fresh baseline
- `/seo-plan` — re-prioritize roadmap

All weekly + monthly results append to `~/wiki/wiki/seo-performance-tracker.md`.

## Living performance wiki

`~/wiki/wiki/seo-performance-tracker.md` is the single source of truth for SEO learnings. Updated by:

- **Daily skill** (Step 11.5b post-deploy audit appends per-post score row)
- **Weekly cron skills** (technical/backlinks/competitor results)
