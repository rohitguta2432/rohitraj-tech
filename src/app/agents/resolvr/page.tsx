        answer:
            "Resolvr is an open-source, self-hosted AI customer support agent that classifies a support ticket, retrieves knowledge-base articles via RAG, decides resolve-vs-escalate behind a safety gate, and drafts a reply. It runs on local Ollama models, so customer data never leaves your server, at zero per-token cost.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I run an AI support agent fully self-hosted so customer data never leaves my server?",
        answer:
            "Yes. Resolvr runs inference on local Ollama by default, so no ticket text is sent to any third-party API. This makes it suitable for GDPR, HIPAA, and air-gapped deployments. A cloud-API fallback exists but is opt-in and off by default.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is there an open-source alternative to Intercom Fin or Zendesk AI that I can self-host?",
        answer:
            "Resolvr is an open-source, self-hostable alternative to Intercom Fin and Zendesk AI. Unlike those SaaS tools it runs on your own server with no per-resolution or per-token fee, and unlike helpdesks such as Chatwoot or Zammad it is an agent-first classify → RAG → resolve/escalate pipeline rather than an inbox with bolt-on AI.",
    },
    {
        question: "How much does Resolvr cost per ticket?",
        answer:
            "Resolvr has zero per-token and zero per-resolution cost — the only cost is the server you already run. This contrasts with per-resolution SaaS pricing such as Intercom Fin's roughly $0.99 per resolution. Note that below a couple of million tokens a day, a cloud API can be cheaper than dedicated GPU infrastructure, which is exactly what the opt-in cloud fallback is for.",
    },
    {
        question: "How does Resolvr decide whether to resolve a ticket or escalate to a human?",
        answer:
            "Resolvr makes a deterministic resolve-vs-escalate decision behind a configurable safety gate. A hard gate always escalates security, legal, abuse, and refund tickets, and low retrieval confidence escalates with full context. Everything else is auto-resolved with a reply grounded in retrieved KB articles.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do AI support agents hallucinate, and how does Resolvr prevent it?",
        answer:
            "Resolvr reduces hallucination two ways: the reply is grounded strictly in knowledge-base articles retrieved via RAG, and a confidence-thresholded safety gate hands low-confidence cases to a human instead of sending them. Its pytest eval suite enforces 100% must-escalate recall on security, legal, and abuse tickets.",
    },
    {
        question: "Which open-source LLM does Resolvr run on Ollama?",
        answer:
            "Resolvr defaults to qwen2.5:14b on local Ollama and works with other Ollama models such as Llama 3.1 and Mistral. Smaller 7B–8B models run on modest GPUs; the hardest tickets can use the opt-in cloud-API fallback when needed.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is self-hosted AI customer support GDPR compliant?",
        answer:
            "Self-hosting is the cleanest GDPR story because no customer data is sent to a third-party processor — there is no external API call to cover with a DPA. Because Resolvr runs true local inference (not PII-masking before a cloud call), ticket data physically stays on your infrastructure, supporting GDPR, data-residency, and air-gapped requirements.",
    },
    {
        question: "What stack is Resolvr built on, and how do I deploy it?",
        answer:
            "Resolvr is built on FastAPI (Python) and React/Vite, with Ollama-based embeddings and cosine-similarity RAG, deterministic classification, and a pytest eval-gated safety layer. It is open source on GitHub and can be deployed end-to-end on your own server; the build guide includes copy-pasteable Ollama and FastAPI steps.",

                            Yes. Because inference runs on local Ollama, no ticket text is sent to any external model by default — which is a materially stronger privacy story than &ldquo;privacy-first&rdquo; SaaS that PII-masks and then sends the rest to a cloud LLM.

                            <li><strong>Opt-in fallback</strong> — the cloud-API tier is off by default, so the privacy guarantee holds unless you explicitly enable it.</li>

                            Resolvr has <strong>zero per-token and zero per-resolution cost</strong> — the only cost is the server you already run. That&apos;s the wedge for teams hit by per-resolution SaaS pricing, where bills scale directly with ticket volume.
                        </p>

                            One honest caveat so this stays credible: below roughly a couple of million tokens a day, a cloud API can be cheaper than running dedicated GPU infrastructure. Resolvr&apos;s value is <strong>privacy and control plus no marginal cost at volume</strong> — and the opt-in cloud fallback covers low-volume or hardest-ticket cases without locking you in.

                            A <strong>safety gate</strong> is a rule layer that overrides the model: certain ticket categories must always reach a human, and anything the agent isn&apos;t confident about is escalated rather than guessed.

                            <li><strong>Hard gate</strong> — security, legal, abuse, and refund tickets always escalate, regardless of how confident retrieval is.</li>
                            <li><strong>Confidence threshold</strong> — when the best KB match is weak, the ticket escalates with full context attached instead of getting a shaky answer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Eval-gated</strong> — a pytest suite enforces <strong>100% must-escalate recall</strong> on security/legal/abuse and ≥90% action accuracy before anything ships.</li>

                            That combination — RAG grounding plus a confidence-thresholded gate — is the direct answer to the &ldquo;but won&apos;t it hallucinate?&rdquo; objection: low-confidence cases go to a human instead of being sent.
