Hire a founding engineer if you have an idea and no product. Hire a fractional CTO if you have a product, a team, and a technical decision that will cost you $100K+ to unwind. Most pre-seed founders think they need a fractional CTO because the word "CTO" sounds like the missing piece. They do not. They need someone who writes code.

That is the whole post in two lines. But the reason founders get this wrong — and end up paying $8K–$20K a month for advice they cannot act on — is because every agency selling fractional CTO services has an incentive to convince you that strategy is your bottleneck. Strategy is never the bottleneck pre-PMF. Shipping is.

A fractional CTO is a part-time strategist. They audit stacks, review architecture, sit in on hiring calls, translate technical tradeoffs to your board, and tell your existing engineers what to build next. A founding engineer is the person who actually builds it. If you have no product, there is nothing for a fractional CTO to audit, no team for them to lead, and no board conversation they can translate. You are paying someone to run meetings about a codebase that does not exist.

I have taken calls with 40+ founders in the last 18 months. Every one who asked me "should I hire a fractional CTO?" was pre-product. Every one of them needed a founding engineer — or, more accurately, a senior contractor on a 6-week sprint — not an advisor. This post lays out the honest trade-off so you can stop shopping for the wrong role.`
    },
    {
      heading: 'What Does a Founding Engineer Actually Do (Day-to-Day)?',
      content: `A founding engineer writes 80% of the code for your first 18 months, makes every architecture call, and owns shipping velocity end-to-end. They are not an advisor. They are the person you will text at 11pm when a Stripe webhook is firing twice.

Typical week for a founding engineer at a pre-seed startup:

- Mon: ships 2 features to staging, reviews 1 PR from a contractor, rewrites the auth flow because Clerk pricing changed
- Tue: pair-programs a complex feature with the founder, debugs a Postgres query taking 4s, writes migration
- Wed: deploys to production, sets up Sentry alerts, fixes 3 bugs from user testing
- Thu: rebuilds billing logic after customer feedback, adds Stripe metered billing, writes integration tests
- Fri: interviews a contractor, reviews their trial task, writes up a 1-page tech doc for investors

They are a builder, not a strategist. The "CTO" part of their title is aspirational — they get the title if the company scales past Series A and they stay. Until then, they are a senior engineer with equity and trauma.

Typical week for a fractional CTO at the same startup:

- 4-hour strategy call with founders Monday
- 2 hours reviewing architecture docs Tuesday
- 1-hour engineering standup facilitation Wednesday
- 2 hours in investor tech diligence calls Thursday
- 3 hours interviewing engineering candidates Friday

You can see the problem. A fractional CTO works 10–20 hours a week and writes zero code. At pre-seed, nothing they do generates revenue. Every hour they spend is an hour your competitor's founding engineer spent shipping.`

      heading: 'What Does Each Role Actually Cost in 2026?',
      content: `A fractional CTO costs $8K–$20K per month for 10–20 hours per week. A founding engineer costs $140K–$220K salary + 0.5–2% equity in the US, or $36K–$72K + 0.2–1% equity in India. A senior contractor on a 6-week MVP sprint costs $15K–$30K flat with zero equity.

Here is the 12-month total cost breakdown, which is the number that matters:

| Role | 12-month cash out | Equity | Hours/week | Lines of code shipped |
|------|-------------------|--------|------------|-----------------------|
| US founding engineer | $210K–$350K | 0.5–2% | 50+ | 20K–40K |
| India founding engineer | $55K–$110K | 0.2–1% | 50+ | 20K–40K |
| Fractional CTO | $96K–$240K | 0.25–0.75% | 10–20 | 0 |
| Senior contractor (6-week sprint) | $15K–$30K flat | 0% | 50 for 6 weeks | 8K–15K |
| Senior contractor (retainer) | $48K–$120K | 0% | 20 | 15K–25K |

A fractional CTO is the **most expensive option per line of code shipped** in this table. They do not ship code. That is not a bug — that is what the role is. The math only works if you already have engineers for them to lead.

If you do not have engineers, and you pay a fractional CTO instead of hiring a builder, you are spending $100K+ in year one to have someone tell you what you already know: "you need to hire engineers." Skip the middleman and hire the builder directly.`
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Signal That Tells You Which One You Need',
      content: `Ask yourself one question: can you describe, in writing, exactly what needs to be built this quarter, feature by feature? If yes, you need a founding engineer or senior contractor — a builder. If no, you need a fractional CTO to help you figure it out. That is the entire decision rule.

Most founders think they are in the second camp. They are not. If you have talked to 20+ potential users, you already know what needs to be built. You just do not know how to build it. "How" is a builder problem, not a strategist problem.

The fractional CTO pitch sounds appealing because it frames hiring as a strategy problem: "which stack, which architecture, which tradeoffs?" In 2026, none of that matters at MVP stage. Next.js + Postgres + Vercel covers 95% of SaaS use cases. React Native + Supabase covers 95% of mobile. You do not need a fractional CTO to pick a stack — you need a builder who has shipped 10 products on one of these stacks and does not need to think about it.

When a fractional CTO is actually the right call:

- You have a 5+ engineer team and your technical co-founder just left
- You are 6 weeks from a Series A close and an investor flagged "technical diligence risk"
- You are scaling past 10K users and your app keeps falling over
- You are post-PMF, have revenue, and need to hire a full-time VP Eng in 6 months
- You are a non-technical founder and your existing engineering team is shipping but not in a direction you trust

Notice what all five have in common: there is already a product, a team, and revenue. If any of those are missing, you are not hiring for a CTO problem. You are hiring for a builder problem.`

      heading: 'The Middle Path Nobody Advertises — Senior Contractor on a 6-Week Sprint',
      content: `The option most founders miss sits between a $25/month AI builder and a $250K founding engineer: hire a senior contractor for a 6-week fixed-scope MVP sprint at $15K–$30K flat. No equity. No long-term commitment. Production-ready code. This is what 60% of my inbound is, and it is what 90% of pre-seed founders should actually be doing.

The math is obvious once you see it. A founding engineer costs you $210K in year one and might not ship for 4–8 weeks because they are setting up the initial codebase. A senior contractor costs you $25K, ships in 6 weeks, and you own the codebase. When you hit product-market fit and raise a seed round, *then* you hire a founding engineer — but now you hire them onto a working product with real users, which means you can attract a better engineer with less equity dilution.

What a 6-week sprint delivers in 2026, as a concrete benchmark:

- Full-stack web app (Next.js or Spring Boot + React) with auth, billing, core features
- Deployed to Vercel or AWS with CI/CD, monitoring, and error tracking
- Database design, migrations, and seed data
- 2–3 integrations (Stripe, SendGrid, one domain API)
- Post-launch: 2 weeks of bug-fix support included
- Clean handoff: full docs, GitHub access, 1-hour knowledge transfer

That is a real product with real users — not a prototype, not a demo. If your idea is valid, you will know within 30 days of launch. If it is not, you are out $25K instead of $250K and you still have equity to give your next founding engineer.

The reason this option is under-marketed is obvious: contractors do not have VC incentives to scale and do not spend $50K/month on content marketing. Fractional CTO agencies do. Guess whose blog posts rank on Google for "how to build an MVP."`

      heading: 'Fractional CTO Red Flags You Should Walk Away From',
      content: `If a fractional CTO proposes a 3-month retainer before writing a single line of code, walk away. If they refuse to do a 2-week paid trial, walk away. If they cannot name three specific technical decisions they would make for your product today, walk away. These are the three filters that separate real fractional CTOs from consultants with LinkedIn Premium.

The fractional CTO market grew fast in 2024–2025 and is now full of people who added the title after one senior engineering job. Real fractional CTOs — the kind who are worth $15K/month — have shipped 3+ products end-to-end, run a 20+ person engineering org, and can explain exactly why they would pick Postgres over DynamoDB for your specific use case in 30 seconds. If you cannot extract that level of specificity in a 30-minute intro call, you are about to hire an advisor, not a CTO.

Questions that separate real CTOs from consultants:

- "What would you change about our architecture in the first 30 days?" (Real CTOs name 2–3 specific things.)
- "Walk me through a past decision where you were wrong and had to reverse it." (Consultants cannot answer this.)
- "If I gave you $50K and 6 weeks, what would you ship?" (Real CTOs sketch a scope; consultants pivot to "it depends.")
- "Who else have you served in this stage, and can I talk to them?" (Real CTOs have 3+ warm references.)
- "Will you sign a 2-week paid trial before a longer engagement?" (Consultants refuse.)

A good fractional CTO is one of the highest-leverage hires a Series A startup can make. A bad one is the most expensive way to burn cash at pre-seed. The difference is visible in 30 minutes if you know what to ask.

For founders reading this and wondering about delivery, the two ways I work are a [founding engineer in India](/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) and a [fractional CTO engagement](/services/hire-fractional-cto-india).

Two posts that pick up where this one ends: [Founding Engineer vs Lovable in 2026](/notes/founding-engineer-vs-lovable-when-to-hire-2026) and [Hire a Founding Engineer in India](/notes/founding-engineer-india-vs-toptal-arc-uplers-2026).`

      heading: 'So Which One Should You Hire in 2026?',
      content: `Pre-seed, no product, no revenue: hire a senior contractor on a 6-week sprint for $15K–$30K. Seed-funded, live product, 2+ engineers already on the team: a fractional CTO at $8K–$15K/month is high-leverage. Series A or later: hire a full-time founding engineer or VP Eng.

The thing I want you to take away from this post is that founder-market-fit applies to hiring, not just products. The fractional CTO role is real, valuable, and worth every dollar — for the right stage. Most founders who ask about it are not in that stage. They are pre-product and they need someone who will open a terminal, not a Google Doc.

If you are in the "pre-product, need to ship" camp and want to see how a 6-week contractor sprint actually works — scope doc, fixed price, code you own on day one — reach out. I ship MVPs in this window for founders on four continents, and the output is the same code I would write as your founding engineer, minus the equity and the 18-month commitment.

You can always hire a fractional CTO later. You cannot un-burn six months validating the wrong idea.`
