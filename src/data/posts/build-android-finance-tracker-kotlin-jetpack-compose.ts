I built FinBaby, an offline-first Android finance tracker using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that automatically imports bank SMS messages from 50+ Indian banks, parses transaction amounts and merchants using regex, auto-categorizes spending, and provides 50/30/20 budgeting with smart saving tips — all without a backend server, cloud account, or bank API linking.

India processes 13 billion+ UPI transactions per month. Every transaction generates a bank SMS. And yet, most Indians either don't track expenses at all, or they manually type numbers into a spreadsheet every weekend (and give up by February).

The problem isn't awareness — everyone knows they should track spending. The problem is **data entry friction**. If logging an expense takes more than 5 seconds, people won't do it consistently.

FinBaby solves this with one feature: **automatic SMS import**. It reads your bank SMS messages, parses the amount, merchant, and date, auto-categorizes the transaction, and shows you exactly where your money went. Zero typing required.

No cloud. No sign-up. No bank linking. Your data never leaves your phone.`

      heading: 'How Does SMS Parsing Work Across 50+ Indian Banks?',
      content: `This was the hardest engineering challenge. Indian bank SMS formats are wildly inconsistent:

- **SBI**: "Your a/c X1234 debited by Rs.500.00 on 15-Apr-26"
- **HDFC**: "Rs 500.00 debited from HDFC Bank A/c **1234 on 15/04/26"
- **ICICI**: "Dear Customer, INR 500.00 debited from your Acct XX1234"
- **Kotak**: "Rs.500 spent on your Kotak card XX1234 at SWIGGY"

Every bank has its own format. Amount placement varies. Date formats vary. Some include merchant names, others don't.

**The parsing engine:**

\`\`\`
sms/
├── SmsReader.kt          # ContentResolver-based SMS reading
├── BankSenderMap.kt       # Maps sender IDs to bank names (50+ banks)
├── TransactionParser.kt   # Regex engine for amount, type, merchant extraction
└── CategorySuggester.kt   # Keyword-to-category mapping
\`\`\`

**BankSenderMap** contains sender ID patterns for 50+ Indian banks. When an SMS arrives from "JM-SBICRD" or "AD-HDFCBK", the parser knows which bank-specific regex to apply.

**CategorySuggester** uses keyword matching — "Swiggy" or "Zomato" maps to Food, "Amazon" maps to Shopping, "Uber" or "Ola" maps to Transport. It's not AI, and it doesn't need to be. Pattern matching handles 80% of cases, and the user can correct the rest in 2 taps.`

      heading: 'What Architecture Powers Room + Hilt + WorkManager?',
      content: `**Room Database** — The single source of truth for all financial data:

- \`transactions\` — Every expense and income entry (SMS-imported or manual)
- \`categories\` — Customizable spending categories with icons
- \`budgets\` — Monthly budget allocations per category
- \`recurring\` — Recurring transactions (rent, EMI, subscriptions)

**Hilt** for dependency injection. Every ViewModel, Repository, and Worker gets its dependencies injected. This keeps the app testable and modular.

**WorkManager** handles three background tasks:
1. **Daily reminders** — "Don't forget to log your cash expenses today"
2. **Recurring transactions** — Auto-creates entries for rent, EMIs, subscriptions on their due dates
3. **Budget alerts** — Notifies when spending crosses 70% or 90% of any category budget

**DataStore Preferences** for settings — currency format, default category, reminder time, biometric toggle.

**Navigation Compose** with a single Activity. Screens:

\`\`\`
Home (Dashboard) → Reports → Budget → Search → Settings
                 → Add Expense (bottom sheet)
                 → Transaction Detail
                 → Tips (Smart Saving Suggestions)
\`\`\`

Single-activity architecture with Compose Navigation. No fragments, no XML layouts.`

      heading: 'The 50/30/20 Budget Engine',
      content: `The 50/30/20 rule is the simplest budgeting framework that actually works:

- **50% Needs** — Rent, groceries, utilities, insurance, EMIs
- **30% Wants** — Dining out, entertainment, shopping, subscriptions
- **20% Savings** — Investments, emergency fund, debt repayment

FinBaby auto-classifies every transaction into one of these buckets based on its category. The dashboard shows three progress bars — one for each bucket — so you can see at a glance whether you're on track.

**Color coding:**
- Green: Under 70% of budget
- Orange: 70-89% of budget
- Red: 90%+ of budget

**Smart Tips engine** analyzes spending patterns and generates personalized suggestions:
- "You spent 40% more on food this month vs. last month. Cooking at home 3x/week could save ₹3,000."
- "Your subscription spending is ₹2,500/month across 6 services. Review if you're using all of them."
- "You have no emergency fund. Even ₹500/month builds a ₹6,000 safety net in a year."

These tips are rule-based, not AI. Deterministic financial calculations are more trustworthy than LLM-generated advice when real money is involved.`

      heading: 'Charts & Reports with Vico',
      content: `Reports needed to answer one question: **where did my money go?**

**Vico Charts** library provides:
- **Donut chart** — Category-wise spending breakdown for the month
- **Daily bar chart** — Spending per day, so you can spot binge-spending days
- **Monthly trend line** — Are you spending more or less over time?

All charts are Jetpack Compose-native. No WebView, no JavaScript bridge. They animate smoothly and respect Material 3 dynamic colors.

**CSV Export** — One tap to export all transactions to CSV. Useful for tax filing, sharing with a financial advisor, or migrating to another app.

**JSON Backup/Restore** — Full database export as encrypted JSON via Gson. Restore on a new phone or after factory reset. No cloud account needed.

**Biometric Lock** — Optional fingerprint/face authentication on app launch. Finance data is sensitive — security without friction.`

      heading: 'Design Philosophy: The Mindful Ledger',
      content: `Finance apps are either boring (spreadsheet-green with tiny text) or overwhelming (20 features on the home screen). FinBaby follows what I call "The Mindful Ledger" design:

- **Teal and amber palette** — Calm, not aggressive. Money management shouldn't feel stressful.
- **Soft minimalism** — No hard borders, tonal layering, generous whitespace
- **Material 3 dynamic color** — Adapts to the user's wallpaper colors on Android 12+
- **Large touch targets** — Designed for one-handed use, especially the expense entry numpad

| Feature | Tech Choice | Why |
|---------|------------|-----|
| UI | Jetpack Compose + Material 3 | Modern declarative UI, dynamic theming |
| Database | Room | Type-safe, migrations, LiveData/Flow integration |
| DI | Hilt | Standard for Android, ViewModel injection |
| Background | WorkManager | Reliable scheduling even with Doze mode |
| Charts | Vico | Compose-native, Material 3 colors |
| SMS | ContentResolver | No third-party SDK needed |
| Settings | DataStore | Coroutine-native, replaces SharedPreferences |

**Total backend cost: ₹0.** Everything runs on the device. The only external dependency is the Play Store listing itself.

**Handling edge cases in SMS parsing:** Bank SMS formats change without warning — a bank might update their SMS template, breaking the regex. FinBaby addresses this with a fallback strategy: if the primary bank-specific regex fails, a generic amount-extraction regex runs that catches most transaction amounts regardless of format. Users can also manually correct any mis-parsed transaction in two taps. The app tracks correction frequency per bank, which helps prioritize regex updates in future releases. This resilience layer ensures the app degrades gracefully rather than silently missing transactions.

**Why rule-based tips over AI-generated financial advice:** The Smart Tips engine uses deterministic calculations — percentage changes month-over-month, subscription counts, emergency fund gaps. These are more trustworthy than LLM-generated financial advice because the calculations are verifiable. When the app says "you spent 40% more on food this month," that number is exact. Users making real financial decisions need precision, not probabilistic suggestions.

The pattern I run for founders in this situation is either a [mobile app development](/services/mobile-app-development) or a [founding engineer in India](/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) — pick based on whether you need shipped code or shipped *and* maintained code.

      heading: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
      content: `**Q: Does FinBaby read SMS messages in the background automatically?**\n\nNo. FinBaby uses ContentResolver to read existing SMS messages when you open the app — it does not run a background SMS listener. This means it processes the SMS inbox on-demand rather than intercepting messages as they arrive. The advantage is lower battery usage and no persistent background service. The trade-off is that new transactions appear when you open the app, not in real-time.\n\n**Q: How accurate is the auto-categorization of transactions?**\n\nKeyword-based categorization handles approximately 80% of transactions correctly. Merchants like Swiggy, Zomato, Amazon, Uber, and Ola are mapped to their respective categories with near-100% accuracy. For less common merchants or ATM withdrawals without merchant names, the app defaults to "Other" and lets the user recategorize in two taps. The correction is remembered for future transactions from the same source.\n\n**Q: Can FinBaby handle multiple bank accounts?**\n\nYes. The BankSenderMap contains sender ID patterns for 50+ Indian banks. When SMS messages arrive from different bank sender IDs, each transaction is parsed and attributed to the correct bank. The dashboard aggregates spending across all accounts, and the reports can be filtered by individual bank account for users who want per-account visibility.\n\n**Q: How does the 50/30/20 budget engine handle irregular income?**\n\nThe budget allocations recalculate monthly based on actual income recorded that month. If income varies — common for freelancers and gig workers — the 50/30/20 splits adjust proportionally. Users can also set a fixed monthly budget manually if they prefer predictable allocations regardless of actual income. The progress bars reflect spending against whichever budget mode is active.\n\n**Q: Is the data exportable if I want to switch to another finance app?**\n\nYes. One-tap CSV export includes all transactions with date, amount, category, merchant, and bank source. The JSON backup contains the complete Room database in encrypted format. Both formats are standard enough to import into spreadsheet apps, accounting software, or other finance trackers. No vendor lock-in — your financial data belongs to you.`
