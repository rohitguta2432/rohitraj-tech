      content: `**Week 27** (June 23–30, 2026): the entire agent loop — model, orchestration, routing — became something you run on your own hardware. **Ornith-1.0** (June 25, MIT, 9B→397B) ships open coding models that write their own harness during RL. **Qwen 3.6 27B** became the local-dev sweet spot — 256k context, **28GB** to run, ~mid-2025 frontier quality. **vLLM's Micro-Agent** turns one API call into a bounded multi-model collaboration. **Herdr** (8.6k★) multiplexes 15+ coding agents in a terminal; **Wayfinder** routes deterministically between local and hosted LLMs. And **Anthropic's Claude Tag** brought async @Claude delegation to Slack.`,

      content: `By [Rohit Raj](/about) — AI Consultant · Forward Deployed Engineer · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitraj2/)

There's a layer of every AI-news cycle the headlines skip — not the models, but the unglamorous plumbing that turns a downloaded checkpoint into something that actually does work. This was the seven days that plumbing finally caught up with the models it has to wrap.

Look at what shipped together. Three open models you run yourself — Ornith-1.0, Qwen 3.6, the still-#1 GLM-5.2 — and three pieces of plumbing that make local-and-multi-model agents *practical*: a terminal multiplexer for your agent fleet, a deterministic local-vs-hosted router, and an in-serving collaboration layer that squeezes frontier-class results out of a single endpoint. A year ago "run it locally" meant "accept worse output and write all the orchestration yourself." This week both halves of that sentence stopped being true. Below: every drop, its source, and one opinionated take.`,

      content: `| Drop | What changed | Date | Verdict |

      heading: 'Ornith-1.0: Did an Open Model Just Learn to Write Its Own Harness? (June 25)',
      content: `**What:** **DeepReinforce** released **Ornith-1.0** on **June 25, 2026** — a family of **MIT-licensed** agentic coding models in **9B, 31B, 35B-MoE, and 397B-MoE** sizes, built on **Gemma 4** and **Qwen 3.5**. The headline isn't the sizes; it's the training. Instead of a fixed, human-crafted agent scaffold, the model **learns to write its own harness during reinforcement learning**, jointly optimizing the scaffold and the code solution. The **397B** tops **Claude Opus 4.7** on both headline benchmarks (though not Opus 4.8 or the larger GLM-5.2-744B), and the **9B** matches or beats Gemma 4-31B and Qwen 3.6 35B — small enough to run on edge hardware.

**Why it matters:** "Self-scaffolding" is the first credible answer to a real problem — most agent frameworks are brittle human-written prompt plumbing. A model that learns its own loop is a different design point, and MIT means you can actually build on it.

**Source:** [DeepReinforce blog](https://deep-reinforce.com/ornith_1_0.html) · [GitHub](https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/Ornith-1) · [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/372361/ornith-open-source-coding-model-built-for-agents)

**Quick take:** The 9B is the one to grab — frontier-ish agentic behavior that fits on a laptop, no per-token meter. The 397B is a benchmark trophy most teams will never self-host. Start at the bottom of the lineup, not the top.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Qwen 3.6 27B: The New Local-Dev Sweet Spot',
      content: `**What:** A widely-shared writeup (**769 points on Hacker News**) made the case that the **dense Qwen 3.6 27B** is the model to run for local development. The specifics: a **256k-token** native context, **8-bit (Q8_0)** quantization needing **28GB of RAM** on Apple Silicon (MLX) or ~41GB on llama.cpp, **18–32 tokens/sec** on a MacBook M5 Max, and an Artificial Analysis score of **37** — roughly mid-2025 frontier capability. The author deliberately picks it over the faster **35B-A3B** MoE (93–105 tok/s) for higher-quality code: "I'd rather generate a third as much, but of higher quality."

**Why it matters:** 28GB is the line where "local model" stops being a toy on a developer laptop. Dense-27B-at-Q8 is the current best capability-per-gigabyte for code work you actually ship.

**Source:** [quesma.com](https://quesma.com/blog/qwen-36-is-awesome/) · [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=48704000)

**Quick take:** The 27B-dense-vs-35B-MoE call is the real lesson — MoE buys you speed, dense buys you quality, and for code you usually want quality. Benchmark both on *your* tasks before committing 28GB of RAM to one.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'GLM-5.2: Still Sitting at the Top',
      content: `**What:** A week after its deep-dive, **Z.ai's GLM-5.2** is still the **#1 trending open-weights model** — **2,957 likes** on Hugging Face this week and a **1,072-point** Hacker News thread titled "GLM 5.2 beats Claude in our benchmarks." Nothing new shipped; it just refused to leave the top of the charts.

**Why it matters:** Staying #1 for two weeks is itself a signal — the open-weights coding lead isn't a one-news-cycle fluke.

**Source:** [HF: zai-org/GLM-5.2](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-5.2)

**Quick take:** I already wrote the full breakdown — [GLM-5.2 vs Claude Opus for coding agents](/notes/glm-5-2-vs-claude-opus-coding-agent-2026). Read that before you assume "tops the leaderboard" means "right for your stack." Running 744B params is the part the benchmark doesn't price.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Herdr: Should You Run Your Agent Fleet in One Terminal? (Show HN)',
      content: `**What:** **Herdr** (**8.6k stars**, **147 points** on Show HN) is a terminal "agent multiplexer" — think tmux, but purpose-built for AI coding agents. Written in **Rust** (90.1% of the codebase), it ships as a **~10MB single binary** with no dependencies and supports **15+ coding agents** (Claude Code, Codex, Devin, and more). Each agent gets its own real terminal pane, you see fleet state at a glance (🔴 blocked, 🟡 working, 🔵 done, 🟢 idle), and sessions persist so you can detach and reattach remotely. There's a socket API for orchestration. It's **AGPL-3.0** with commercial licenses available.

**Why it matters:** The moment you run more than two agents in parallel, "which one is stuck?" becomes the actual bottleneck. Herdr makes fleet state legible instead of buried in scrollback.

**Source:** [Herdr on GitHub](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr)

**Quick take:** This only earns its place once you genuinely run agents in parallel — for one-agent-at-a-time work it's overhead. But if you're already juggling tabs, the state-at-a-glance view alone is worth the install. Mind the AGPL if you embed it.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Wayfinder Router: Can You Route Local-vs-Hosted Without Guessing? (Show HN)',
      content: `**What:** **Wayfinder Router** (**121 points** on Show HN) is a small CLI that routes each query **deterministically** between a local and a hosted LLM. The design choice that stands out: **cost is metadata only** — it's reported on a \`/metrics\` endpoint and shapes the calibrated cutoff, but never enters the per-request decision, which stays deterministic and free. It forwards to any OpenAI-style \`/chat/completions\` endpoint (Groq, Together, OpenRouter, Fireworks, DeepSeek, plus local vLLM / LM Studio / llama.cpp), supports \`auto\` / \`prefer-local\` / \`prefer-hosted\` directives and a per-request **\`X-Wayfinder-Threshold\`** header (0.0–1.0), and the terminal UI shows where it routed (● LOCAL / ◆ CLOUD) plus running savings vs always-cloud.

**Why it matters:** "Use the cheap local model when you can, the expensive one when you must" is the obvious cost play — but most routers make it a non-deterministic black box. Determinism means you can actually test and reproduce routing decisions.

**Source:** [wayfinder-router on GitHub](https://github.com/itsthelore/wayfinder-router)

**Quick take:** Determinism is the right call — a router you can't reproduce is a router you can't debug. Pair it with the Qwen 3.6 27B above as your local tier and a hosted frontier as the escalation, and watch the savings counter.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'vLLM Micro-Agent: Make the Serving Layer Do the Orchestration (June 29)',
      content: `**What:** On **June 29**, **vLLM** published **Micro-Agent** — turning a single model API call (\`vllm-sr/auto\`) into "a bounded collaboration inside the serving layer." Instead of you wiring multi-model orchestration in app code, the inference server runs one of **five "looper" patterns** behind a stable endpoint: **Confidence** (escalate cheap→strong), **Ratings** (parallel multi-model), **ReMoM** (multiple reasoning attempts + synthesis), **Fusion** (panel + judge), and **Workflows** (planner/patcher/verifier roles). Reported results: **92.6% on LiveCodeBench**, **96.0% on GPQA-Diamond**, **50.0% on Humanity's Last Exam** — matching or beating Fugu Ultra, from closed-model backends, with no app-code changes.

**Why it matters:** Pushing orchestration *into the serving layer* means the collaboration logic lives once, in infra, instead of being re-implemented in every app. That's a genuinely different place to draw the line.

**Source:** [vLLM blog](https://vllm.ai/blog/2026-06-29-micro-agent-frontier-models)

**Quick take:** The interesting bit isn't the benchmark — it's *where* the orchestration lives. If looper-style collaboration becomes a serving-layer primitive, half of today's agent frameworks become a config flag. Watch this pattern, even if you don't adopt it yet.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Anthropic Claude Tag: Async Delegation Lands in Slack (June 23)',
      content: `**What:** **Anthropic** launched **Claude Tag** in beta on **June 23, 2026** for **Claude Enterprise and Team**. You tag **@Claude** in a Slack channel to delegate a task; it builds context from channel history, connects to specified tools and data sources, and works **asynchronously** — even **proactively** ("ambient" behavior). It runs on **Opus 4.8**, with memories **scoped per channel** for security, and is positioned as an evolution of Claude Code into a team-collaboration surface.

**Why it matters:** This is the hosted incumbents' answer to the same question the open stack is chasing — how does an agent live *inside* your workflow instead of in a separate window? Slack is where the work conversation already happens.

**Source:** [Anthropic news](https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude-tag)

**Quick take:** Channel-scoped memory is the detail that matters — without it, a chat-summoned agent is a data-leak waiting to happen. Enterprise/Team-only for now, so most indie devs are watching, not using.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'What I\'m Shipping With This Week',
      content: `Concretely: I pulled **Ornith-1.0-9B** down and stood it up as a local Ollama model (\`ornith:9b\`) to be the cheap reasoning tier for [Resolvr](/projects), my support-resolution agent — the routine "which knowledge-base doc answers this ticket" work that never needed a frontier API.

The non-obvious part — the integration that is *not* in the README: the upstream GGUF ships with a **passthrough chat template** (\`{{ .Prompt }}\`) and no stop tokens. Load it as-is and the model never knows when to stop talking — you get a runaway generation loop on the very first turn. The fix is to override the Modelfile with the proper **Qwen3 chat template plus explicit stop tokens** before it's usable at all. Nobody tells you this; you discover it when your first prompt spins for 90 seconds and fills the terminal.

That's the recurring tax on every "just run it locally" drop in this roundup: the weights download in minutes, and then you spend an afternoon on templates, stop tokens, quantization, and VRAM headroom. **Open weights move the work, they don't delete it.** Budget the afternoon, not just the download.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Skip These',
      content: `**DeepSeek-V4-Pro-DSpark, for now.** Yet another **DeepSeek-V4** variant trended on Hugging Face (**227 likes**) this week. DeepSeek ships fast and the lineage is strong, but the Nth same-family variant in a month is a "wait for independent benchmarks" situation, not a "swap your stack today" one. Let the leaderboards settle.

**"Claude Code read my MRI" as a pattern.** A post about using Claude Code to get a second opinion on an MRI scan hit **552 points** — a genuinely cool individual story, and a terrible template for a product. Don't wire a coding agent into a medical-decision path because a viral post made it look easy. Different stakes, different regulatory floor, different failure cost.`,

      heading: 'Need Help Wiring This Week\'s Drops Into Your Product?',
      content: `If this week convinced you to run an open model locally for the routine work — standing up **Ornith-1.0-9B** or **Qwen 3.6 27B**, putting a **Wayfinder**-style router in front of a hosted fallback, or letting the serving layer do the orchestration — the download is the easy part. The hard part is the production wiring: templates and stop tokens, quantization and VRAM, deterministic routing, spend caps, and the load tests nobody writes.
