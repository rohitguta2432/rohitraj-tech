React Native is the better choice for startups that need to ship fast across iOS and Android with a single JavaScript codebase, especially if you already have web developers who know React. Flutter is the better choice for apps that demand pixel-perfect custom UI, complex animations, and consistent rendering across every platform including desktop and embedded devices.

Both React Native and Flutter are mature, production-ready frameworks. Instagram, Shopify, and Discord use React Native. Google Pay, BMW, and Alibaba use Flutter. Neither is going anywhere.

I build with React Native. I've shipped SanatanApp (a devotional app on Google Play) and multiple client projects with it. I'm not going to pretend I'm unbiased — but I'll give you the honest trade-offs so you can decide for yourself.

The real question isn't "which is better?" It's "which is better for YOUR team, YOUR timeline, and YOUR app?"`

      heading: 'Which Framework Has Better Performance?',
      content: `| Factor | React Native (New Arch) | Flutter |
|--------|------------------------|---------|
| Rendering | Native components via Fabric | Custom Skia rendering engine |
| Startup time | ~800ms | ~600ms |
| Animation (60fps) | Achievable with Reanimated 3 | Native 60fps, easier to achieve |
| App size (minimal) | ~15MB (Expo) | ~20MB |
| Hot reload | Fast Refresh (~200ms) | Hot Reload (~300ms) |
| Bridge overhead | Eliminated with JSI (New Architecture) | No bridge — Dart compiles to native |

**Flutter wins on raw animation performance.** Its custom rendering engine means pixel-perfect consistency across platforms and buttery animations out of the box.

**React Native wins on native feel.** Because it renders actual platform components, your app looks and behaves like a native iOS/Android app. Flutter apps have a subtle "not quite native" feel — especially on iOS where users notice these things.

For SanatanApp, React Native was the right choice. The app is content-heavy (text, audio streaming) with minimal complex animations. The native text rendering matters when you're displaying Sanskrit and Hindi typography.

**Common Mistakes When Evaluating Performance:**

Many developers benchmark the wrong things. They compare "hello world" rendering speed or widget tree depth, which tells you nothing about real app performance. What matters is: how fast does your app launch from cold start on a mid-range Android phone? How smooth is scrolling through a list of 500 items? Does your app maintain 60fps during navigation transitions? I've seen Flutter apps that stutter on budget Android devices because developers relied on the framework's default rendering without optimizing their widget tree. Similarly, React Native apps that skip Reanimated and use JavaScript-driven animations will always feel janky. Test on real devices, not simulators — the performance gap between an iPhone 15 Pro and a Redmi Note 12 is enormous, and most of your Indian users are on the latter.`

      heading: 'Which Has a Better Developer Experience and Ecosystem?',
      content: `**React Native advantages:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript — your web developers can contribute immediately
- Expo ecosystem — push updates without app store review (EAS Update)
- npm ecosystem — 2M+ packages, most work with React Native
- Shared code with Next.js/React web apps — up to 70% code reuse
- Debugging in Chrome DevTools — familiar for web developers

**Flutter advantages:**
- Dart is a clean, well-designed language (but nobody else uses it)
- Widget system is more cohesive than React Native's component model
- Better built-in testing tools
- Google's Material Design 3 components look great out of the box
- Single codebase for iOS, Android, web, desktop, and embedded

**The Dart problem:** The biggest issue with Flutter is Dart. It's a good language, but it's only used for Flutter. If you hire a Dart developer and later pivot away from Flutter, their skills don't transfer. JavaScript/TypeScript developers, on the other hand, can work on your web app, backend (Node.js), and mobile app.

**Hiring in India:** React Native developers are significantly easier to find. Most web developers already know React, and the jump to React Native is small. Flutter developers exist but are a smaller pool, and many are junior (learned Flutter as their first framework).

**What I Would Do Differently:**

If I were starting SanatanApp over today, I would still choose React Native, but I would adopt Expo from day one instead of ejecting mid-project. Expo's managed workflow in 2026 supports almost every native module you need — push notifications, in-app purchases, background audio, and even custom native modules via config plugins. Ejecting costs you weeks of build configuration headaches. I'd also invest in a shared component library between the mobile app and a future web version using React Native Web. Code sharing between platforms is one of React Native's strongest advantages, and I underutilized it in my first build.`
    },
    {
      heading: 'My Recommendation',
      content: `**Choose React Native if:**
- Your team already knows React or JavaScript
- You have a web app and want code sharing
- You need native platform look-and-feel
- You want the largest possible hiring pool
- You're building a content app, e-commerce app, or business tool

**Choose Flutter if:**
- You're building a heavily animated, design-first app (games, creative tools)
- You need pixel-perfect consistency across platforms
- Your team is starting fresh (no existing JS knowledge)
- You're targeting desktop + mobile + web from a single codebase
- Google's ecosystem is central to your product

**For most startups building business apps, I recommend React Native.** The ecosystem is larger, hiring is easier, and code sharing with web is a real advantage. Flutter is the better choice for apps where custom UI and animation are the core product.

When I built SanatanApp, the Expo ecosystem saved me weeks — over-the-air updates, easy audio streaming with expo-av, and a ~15MB APK without fighting native build tools. That's the kind of practical advantage that matters when you're shipping on a deadline.

If you want this shipped end-to-end without the team-of-five overhead, the [mobile app development](/services/mobile-app-development) and [6-week MVP sprint](/services/6-week-mvp) options are the routes I take on.

      heading: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
      content: `**Q: Can I use React Native for a complex app with heavy animations?**

Yes, but you need to use Reanimated 3 and the New Architecture (Fabric + JSI). With these tools, React Native can achieve consistent 60fps animations for most use cases. However, if your entire app is animation-driven — like a game or creative tool — Flutter's Skia rendering engine gives you more control with less effort. For apps where animations supplement content rather than define it, React Native handles it well.

**Q: Is Flutter dying in 2026?**

No. Flutter has a strong community, active development from Google, and growing adoption in enterprise apps. The concern around Flutter is not about the framework dying — it is about the Dart ecosystem being smaller than JavaScript. Flutter is a safe choice for greenfield projects where you control the hiring pipeline. The risk is only if you need to pivot your tech stack later and your team's skills do not transfer.

**Q: Which framework has better community support?**

React Native has a larger community because it builds on the massive JavaScript and React ecosystem. You will find more Stack Overflow answers, more npm packages, and more hiring candidates. Flutter's community is smaller but more focused and cohesive — the official documentation is excellent and the widget catalog is well-maintained. For troubleshooting obscure issues, React Native's larger community gives you better odds of finding a solution quickly.

**Q: Can I share code between React Native mobile and a React web app?**

Yes, and this is one of React Native's strongest advantages. Using React Native Web, you can share up to 70 percent of your codebase between mobile and web. Business logic, API clients, state management, and many UI components work across both platforms. Flutter also supports web, but its web output is a canvas-rendered app that does not feel like a native website and has poor SEO characteristics compared to a standard React web app.

**Q: Which framework should I learn in 2026 as a new developer?**

If you already know JavaScript or React, learn React Native. The transition is smooth and your skills transfer across web, mobile, and backend development. If you are starting from scratch with no web experience, Flutter's cohesive widget system and strong documentation make it slightly easier to learn as a first mobile framework. Either way, pick one and build a real project — portfolio projects matter more than framework choice on a resume.`
