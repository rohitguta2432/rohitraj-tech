**The short answer:** if your MVP is web-first or web+mobile, pick Supabase Pro at $25/month. At 10K monthly active users on an Indian MVP, Supabase Pro costs about ₹2,600/month all-in versus Firebase Blaze at ₹4,800-₹12,000/month depending on SMS auth volume and media egress. The delta is 2-4x in Supabase's favour and the gap widens as you cross 25K MAU. If your MVP is mobile-only, push-notification-heavy, and you need Crashlytics + Remote Config out of the box, Firebase still wins — but you pay for that convenience.

**The cost gap is structural, not a temporary promo.** Firebase Blaze charges per-operation (reads, writes, egress, SMS) on top of a generous-looking Spark free tier that Google tightened in February 2026 — daily reads dropped from 50K to 25K, writes from 20K to 10K, and Phone Auth on Spark now caps at 50 verifications/day. The moment your MVP crosses those new limits you are paying per call forever. Supabase Pro is a $25 flat fee that includes 100K MAU, 250GB egress, 8GB Postgres, daily backups, pgvector, and pg_cron. The pricing model is the difference.

**The structural reason this matters now:** Supabase opened the AWS ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region in November 2025, closing the one real advantage Firebase had — sub-50ms latency to Indian users. Firebase has had asia-south1 since 2017, but Supabase Mumbai means the 2026 latency story is now a draw. With latency neutralized, the comparison reduces to pricing model, developer experience, and lock-in — and on all three Supabase wins for the typical Indian MVP profile.`,

      heading: 'The real cost math at 10K MAU on an Indian MVP',
      content: `I ran this exact comparison last month when migrating a client's clinic-booking app from Firebase Blaze to Supabase Pro. The app has 11,400 MAU, OTP-based auth, ~150K Firestore reads/day, ~22K writes/day, 2.1GB storage for profile pictures, and roughly 55GB egress/month from image serving. Here is the actual rupee delta after one full billing cycle on each.

| Metric | Firebase Blaze | Supabase Pro |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Base tier | Pay-as-you-go | $25/month flat |
| Firestore/Postgres reads | 4.5M/mo, 3M paid → $1.80 | Included |
| Firestore/Postgres writes | 660K/mo, 360K paid → $0.65 | Included |
| Storage (2.1GB media) | $0.054 | Included |
| Egress (55GB/mo) | 45GB paid → $5.40 | Included (250GB) |
| Phone Auth SMS (India) | $0.06 × 2,400 verifications = $144 | Bring-your-own MSG91 ₹0.50 × 2,400 = ₹1,200 = $14.40 |
| Cloud Functions / Edge Functions | 1.4M invocations = $0.16 | Included (500K free, then $2/1M) |
| **Total monthly cost** | **$152.07 ≈ ₹12,672** | **$39.40 ≈ ₹3,283** |
| Annualized | ₹1,52,064 | ₹39,396 |
| **Delta** | — | **₹1,12,668/year saved** |

That ₹1.12 lakh annual saving funds a Hetzner CX42 for redundancy, six months of OpenAI Tier-1 API spend, or three weeks of a senior contractor's rate.

**The SMS auth line is doing most of the work.** Firebase's Phone Auth pricing is the killer for any Indian MVP that does OTP signup — Google charges $0.06/verification while MSG91, Gupshup, or Twilio India routes cost ₹0.40-₹0.60. Supabase lets you wire your own SMS provider; Firebase forces their managed rate. On a media-light, OAuth-only app the gap narrows to roughly 2x, but the moment Indian phone OTP is in the loop, Firebase becomes 4-6x more expensive.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Latency from India: the Mumbai region war is over',
      content: `Until late 2025, Firebase had a structural India advantage — asia-south1 in Mumbai meant sub-50ms p95 latency for Firestore reads from Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Delhi NCR. Supabase ran primarily out of ap-southeast-1 (Singapore), adding ~70-90ms of round-trip on every query.

In November 2025 Supabase shipped AWS ap-south-1 (Mumbai) as a primary region. I measured p95 latency from my Bangalore home connection to a fresh Supabase project in ap-south-1 last week — 28ms for a simple SELECT, 41ms for a join across two tables. Firebase asia-south1 from the same connection clocked 32ms for a Firestore document read. They are within margin of error.

**What this means for an Indian MVP:** the latency excuse for picking Firebase no longer holds. Both backends now sit ~30ms from a typical Indian user. Choose on price, RLS flexibility, and lock-in instead.

The one remaining latency concern is Supabase Realtime — it currently runs out of the project's primary region, so a Mumbai-based project gets Mumbai-based websocket fanout. Firebase Realtime Database runs out of asia-southeast1 (Singapore) for India users until you explicitly request asia-south1 Firestore. If your app does live cursors or chat, the configuration matters. For typical CRUD apps, neither is a bottleneck.

I migrated [StellarMIND's pgvector workload](/projects/stellarmind) to Supabase ap-south-1 in December 2025 — embedding similarity searches dropped from 110ms p95 (Singapore) to 34ms p95 (Mumbai). For RAG-heavy Indian MVPs, this latency drop alone justified the migration even before the cost math.`,

      heading: 'Postgres RLS vs Firestore Security Rules — the security model gap',
      content: `Firestore Security Rules use a Google-specific DSL that runs at the edge. Rules look like:

\`\`\`javascript
match /clinics/{clinicId}/patients/{patientId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerUid;
  allow write: if request.auth != null
    && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/clinics/$(clinicId))
       .data.staff[request.auth.uid] == true;
}
\`\`\`

Postgres Row Level Security in Supabase uses standard SQL:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE POLICY "patient read own"
  ON patients FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = owner_uid);

CREATE POLICY "staff read clinic patients"
  ON patients FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM clinic_staff
      WHERE clinic_staff.clinic_id = patients.clinic_id
        AND clinic_staff.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
\`\`\`

**The trade-off is verbosity for power.** Firestore Rules are simpler — one file, document-scoped, no joins. Postgres RLS lets you express any predicate SQL can express, including subqueries, joins across tables, aggregate checks, and time-window logic that Firestore Rules cannot match. For complex multi-tenant SaaS like the clinic app, this matters: I had eight Firestore Rules spread across nested documents trying to express "staff at clinic X can see patients of clinic X but only during their shift hours". One Postgres RLS policy with a join handled the same logic cleanly.

**The footgun warning is real.** Supabase RLS is harder to get right initially — every table needs RLS enabled, every operation needs a policy, and missing one means data leaks. I wrote about [the five Supabase RLS bugs every vibe-coded app hits](/notes/supabase-rls-production-bugs-need-real-engineer-2026) precisely because the framework gives you SQL power without the SQL-shaped guardrails. Firestore Rules are easier to write but force you into denormalized data layouts that get expensive at scale. Pick your trade.`,

      content: `Below is the full feature comparison I use during scoping calls with founders deciding between the two. The "Verdict" column reflects what fits a typical Indian MVP at 5K-50K MAU.

| Capability | Firebase Blaze | Supabase Pro $25 | Verdict |
|------------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Database model | NoSQL document (Firestore) | Postgres SQL | Supabase for analytics + joins |
| Realtime sync | Native, websocket-based | Native, Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY | Tie |
| Auth providers | Email, Google, Apple, Phone, Anonymous | Email, OAuth (12 providers), Phone, Magic Link | Tie |
| SMS OTP cost (India) | $0.06/verification, fixed | Bring-your-own (₹0.50 via MSG91) | Supabase 4-6x cheaper |
| Storage | $0.026/GB-month + egress | 100GB included, 250GB egress | Supabase for media-heavy apps |
| Mobile push (FCM) | Native, free, best-in-class | Not bundled — use OneSignal or Expo | Firebase for mobile-first |
| Crashlytics | Included, free | Not bundled — use Sentry | Firebase for mobile-first |
| Vector search | Not native — add Vertex AI ($) | pgvector included | Supabase for RAG/AI MVPs |
| Cron jobs | Cloud Scheduler $0.10/job/mo | pg_cron included | Supabase |
| Local development | Emulator suite | Supabase CLI + Docker | Tie, both excellent |
| Cold-start (Functions) | 2-5s on Node | 50-200ms on Deno Edge | Supabase Edge faster |
| Vendor lock-in | High — proprietary APIs | Low — standard Postgres + S3 | Supabase by a mile |
| India region | asia-south1 (Mumbai) since 2017 | ap-south-1 (Mumbai) since Nov 2025 | Tie |
| Free tier ceiling | Tightened Feb 2026 | 500MB DB, 50K MAU, 2GB egress | Supabase free tier larger |

**Lock-in is the underrated dimension.** Firestore is a Google-only product. If Firebase pricing doubles next year, your only escape is a full rewrite to a different document store or a relational mapping that destroys your access patterns. Supabase is Postgres plus open-source services — you can self-host the entire stack on a $40 VM if Supabase's pricing ever stops working for you. The exit cost is hours, not months.`,

    {
      heading: 'When Firebase still wins — the honest counter-position',
      content: `I am not writing a Firebase hit piece. There are three concrete MVP profiles where Firebase remains the better choice in 2026, and I have recommended it to founders four times in the last six months.

**Profile 1: Mobile-only consumer app with FCM push as a core flow.** Firebase Cloud Messaging is the industry-standard push pipeline, free, and deeply integrated with Android and iOS SDKs. Bolting OneSignal or Expo Notifications onto Supabase works but adds a $9/month tool, an extra SDK, and a fanout layer to maintain. For a B2C app that sends millions of pushes (gaming, food delivery, social), Firebase saves you a vendor and a moving part.

**Profile 2: Mobile-first MVP needing Crashlytics + Remote Config + A/B Testing on day one.** Firebase bundles Crashlytics (free crash reporting), Remote Config (feature flags), and A/B Testing (experiment framework) into one console. Reproducing this stack on Supabase needs Sentry ($26/mo), LaunchDarkly or PostHog feature flags ($0-50/mo), and probably PostHog for experiments. For a mobile team of three shipping fast, the Firebase console is the cheaper time investment even if the monthly bill is higher.

**Profile 3: Anonymous user heavy product where authentication is a feature, not a requirement.** Firebase Anonymous Auth lets users start using your app instantly with a backend-generated UID, then optionally upgrade to a real account. Supabase supports anonymous sign-in since v2.41 (early 2025) but the migration UX is rougher and the documentation is thinner. For a viral consumer app where most users never sign up, Firebase's flow is more polished.

**The pattern:** Firebase wins on bundled mobile tooling and on managed convenience. Supabase wins on cost, SQL power, and not being locked into Google. If you are building [an Indian SaaS or B2B MVP](/services/6-week-mvp), Supabase is almost always right. If you are building a B2C mobile app shipping to Play Store and App Store in the next sprint, Firebase still has the edge.`,

      heading: 'The 5-step decision tree for your MVP in 2026',
      content: `Use this checklist to pick in under five minutes. I run it with every founder on a scoping call.

1. **Is your MVP web-first or web+mobile?** Web-first → Supabase. Mobile-only → continue to step 2.
2. **Do you need FCM push as a day-one flow?** Yes → Firebase. No → continue to step 3.
3. **Will more than 30% of your auth volume be Indian phone OTP?** Yes → Supabase (the SMS arbitrage alone funds the migration). No → continue to step 4.
4. **Do you need vector search, complex joins, time-window queries, or analytical aggregations?** Yes → Supabase (Postgres SQL is the right tool). No → continue to step 5.
5. **Are you certain you will stay under 25K MAU for the next 12 months and do not need Crashlytics?** Yes → either works, pick on team familiarity. No → Supabase (the cost curve crosses around 10-15K MAU and Supabase widens the gap).

**The migration cost is real but bounded.** When I moved the clinic-booking app from Firebase to Supabase, the engineering effort was 47 hours over two weeks — schema redesign from Firestore documents to Postgres tables, RLS policies replacing security rules, OAuth provider reconfiguration, and a one-time data migration script. The annualized saving paid that back inside three months. If your MVP is already in production on Firebase with 50K+ MAU, the migration is worth doing today; if you are still pre-launch, just start on Supabase and skip the migration entirely.`,
