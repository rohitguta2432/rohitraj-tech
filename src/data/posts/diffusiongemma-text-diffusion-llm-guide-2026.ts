On **June 10, 2026**, Google [open-sourced DiffusionGemma](https://developers.googleblog.com/diffusiongemma-the-developer-guide/) — the first member of the Gemma family that generates text by **diffusion** rather than by the autoregressive, one-token-at-a-time process every mainstream LLM has used since GPT-2. Instead of writing a sentence word by word, DiffusionGemma starts with a 256-token canvas of placeholder tokens and **refines the whole block in parallel** over a handful of denoising passes, the same way an image-diffusion model resolves a picture out of noise.

The capability that changed is not a benchmark — it is **throughput**. Because the model finalizes ~15–20 tokens across the canvas on every pass rather than emitting exactly one, it hits output speeds that autoregressive decoding structurally cannot: **up to 4x faster than standard Gemma 4** on the same hardware, per [Google's announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/diffusiongemma-the-developer-guide/) and [NVIDIA's accelerated numbers](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-local-gemma-diffusion/). For interactive, on-device, and agentic loops where latency is the user experience, that is the whole ballgame.

The honest part — and the reason this is a developer decision, not a free upgrade — is that Google does not hide the catch. [As MarkTechPost summarized](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/06/10/google-ai-releases-diffusiongemma-a-26b-moe-open-model-using-text-diffusion-for-up-to-4x-faster-generation/), DiffusionGemma stays **below standard Gemma 4 on quality**; you are trading some answer quality for a large speed win. This post is the build-focused read: what actually shipped, how text diffusion works, how to run it locally, the speed-vs-quality math, and when you should just keep using a normal autoregressive model.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'What actually shipped on June 10, 2026?',
      content: `DiffusionGemma is a **26B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts** built on the Gemma 4 backbone (the **26B-A4B** trim), activating only **3.8B parameters per token** at inference ([MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/06/10/google-ai-releases-diffusiongemma-a-26b-moe-open-model-using-text-diffusion-for-up-to-4x-faster-generation/)). It ships under **Apache 2.0** — genuinely open weights you can deploy commercially — at \`google/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it\` on Hugging Face, plus an NVFP4-quantized build at \`nvidia/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-NVFP4\` for RTX hardware.

The spec sheet that matters for builders:

- **Context window:** 256K tokens, with multimodal input (text, image, video) and text output.
- **Languages:** 140+.
- **Memory footprint:** ~**18GB VRAM** quantized — meaning it fits on a single 24GB consumer card.
- **Throughput:** **1000+ tokens/sec on an H100**, **700+ on an RTX 5090**, ~**150 on a DGX Spark**, and up to **2000 on a DGX Station** ([NVIDIA](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-local-gemma-diffusion/)).
- **Day-zero runtimes:** Hugging Face Transformers and **vLLM** (native diffusion serving), plus MLX for Apple silicon, Unsloth and NeMo for fine-tuning, and llama.cpp "coming soon" for GeForce RTX.

The throughput numbers are the headline, but the **18GB quantized footprint** is the quietly important one. A model that clears 700 tokens/sec inside the memory budget of a single RTX 5090 or a Mac with enough unified memory is a model you can put **on the edge**, not just behind a cloud API. That is where text diffusion gets interesting for product work.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'How does text diffusion generate a whole block at once?',
      content: `Autoregressive models like Gemma 4, GPT, and Claude predict token N+1 from tokens 1…N, then append it and repeat. The dependency chain is strictly left-to-right, so generating 256 tokens takes 256 sequential forward passes. That serial chain is the latency floor you cannot optimize away without changing the algorithm.

DiffusionGemma changes the algorithm. Per [Google's developer guide](https://developers.googleblog.com/diffusiongemma-the-developer-guide/), it works like this:

1. It starts with a **256-token canvas of random placeholder tokens**.
2. Over multiple **denoising passes**, it refines all positions in parallel using **bidirectional attention** — every position can see every other, not just the ones to its left.
3. On each pass, the **highly confident tokens get committed** and help resolve their neighbors; roughly **15–20 tokens finalize per pass** across the canvas.
4. For sequences longer than 256 tokens, **Block Autoregressive Diffusion** kicks in: once a block is fully denoised, it commits to the KV cache and a fresh 256-token canvas opens for the next block.
5. A **re-noising** step lets the model self-correct — it can throw a wrong token back into the noise and re-resolve it, which pure left-to-right decoding can never do.

The bidirectional attention is the conceptual payoff. An autoregressive model that writes itself into a corner has no way back; it has already committed the earlier tokens. A diffusion model sees the whole block at once, so it can satisfy constraints that span the sequence. Google's flagship demo is **Sudoku**: the base model scores ~**0%**, but a fine-tune jumps to **~80% correctness**, because solving a grid is exactly a "every cell depends on every other cell" problem that left-to-right generation is bad at ([Google](https://developers.googleblog.com/diffusiongemma-the-developer-guide/)).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'How do you run DiffusionGemma locally on an RTX 5090?',
      content: `The fastest path to a real local endpoint is **vLLM**, which has native diffusion serving on day zero. Google's own [developer guide](https://developers.googleblog.com/diffusiongemma-the-developer-guide/) ships this serve command, which I would start from on a single 24GB card:

\`\`\`bash
# Serve DiffusionGemma with vLLM (native diffusion path)
vllm serve google/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it \\
  --max-model-len 262144 \\
  --max-num-seqs 4 \\
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.85
\`\`\`

That exposes an OpenAI-compatible \`/v1/chat/completions\` endpoint, so your existing client code does not change — you point your base URL at \`http://localhost:8000/v1\` and call it like any other model:

\`\`\`python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="local")

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="google/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Rewrite this commit message to be clearer: 'fix stuff'"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
\`\`\`

A few knobs that actually matter in practice:

- **\`--max-num-seqs 4\`** caps concurrency. Diffusion throughput is highest at low concurrency on a single consumer GPU; push it too high and you thrash VRAM. Benchmark your real batch size.
- On **RTX hardware**, the **NVFP4 build** (\`nvidia/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-NVFP4\`) is the one to grab — it is the quantization that gets you to the ~18GB footprint and the 700 tok/s figure ([NVIDIA](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-local-gemma-diffusion/)).
- If you just want to feel the speed before installing anything, NVIDIA hosts it at **build.nvidia.com**, and Google has it in **Cloud Model Garden**.

If 18GB still does not fit your target device, this is the same on-device tradeoff I keep hitting on edge AI work — and it is the reason I weigh local inference economics carefully in posts like [DeepSeek vs Claude vs GPT for India MVP cost](/en/notes/deepseek-vs-claude-vs-gpt-india-mvp-cost-2026).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'DiffusionGemma vs Gemma 4 vs autoregressive LLMs',
      content: `Here is the decision in one table. "Autoregressive" stands in for the normal way every other production LLM (Gemma 4, GPT, Claude, Llama) generates text.

| Dimension | DiffusionGemma (26B-A4B) | Standard Gemma 4 | Generic autoregressive LLM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generation method | Parallel denoising of a 256-token block | One token at a time, left-to-right | One token at a time, left-to-right |
| Speed (RTX 5090) | **700+ tokens/sec** | ~1x baseline (up to 4x slower) | Hardware-dependent, serial floor |
| Quality | **Below Gemma 4** | Higher | Varies; frontier models higher |
| Attention | Bidirectional during denoising | Causal (left-to-right) | Causal |
| Self-correction | Yes (re-noising) | No | No |
| Constraint problems (e.g. Sudoku) | Strong (0%→~80% fine-tuned) | Weak | Weak |
| VRAM (quantized) | ~18GB | Varies by size | Varies |
| License | Apache 2.0 | Gemma terms | Varies |
| Best for | Latency-critical, interactive, on-device | General quality-first work | General quality-first work |

Where DiffusionGemma genuinely shines, based on Google's stated use cases and the architecture:

- **Interactive editing and rewrites.** Inline "rephrase this," "fix this commit message," autocomplete-style loops where the user is staring at a cursor. 4x lower latency is the difference between a tool that feels instant and one that feels laggy.
- **Constraint satisfaction.** Anything where the answer must globally satisfy rules — structured generation, fill-in-the-middle code, templated output, scheduling-style puzzles — plays to bidirectional attention.
- **On-device and offline-first apps.** 700 tok/s in an 18GB footprint is a real edge model, not a demo.

Where it does not: open-ended reasoning, long-form quality writing, agentic chains where one bad token derails the run. For those, the quality gap costs you more than the speed saves.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'When should you skip DiffusionGemma?',
      content: `This is where most launch-day coverage stops, so it is the part worth getting right. **Default to skipping DiffusionGemma** if any of these are true:

- **Quality is your bottleneck, not latency.** Google says the quality is below Gemma 4. If your users are waiting on the answer being *right*, not *fast*, a faster-but-worse model is a downgrade. Most chat and analysis products are quality-bound.
- **You run a long agentic chain.** Diffusion's self-correction helps inside a block, but a 50-step agent loop compounds small quality drops into derailed runs. I would keep a frontier autoregressive model on the planner and reserve diffusion for narrow, fast sub-tasks.
- **You do not control the hardware.** The entire value proposition is throughput on a GPU you own (RTX 5090, H100, DGX, Apple silicon). If you are calling a hosted API where you pay per token anyway, the speed edge mostly evaporates and you are left with the quality deficit.
- **You need a proven, boring model.** This shipped on June 10, 2026. The tooling (llama.cpp support is still "coming soon"), the eval coverage, and the production war stories do not exist yet. For anything customer-facing and revenue-critical, let it bake.

The clean mental model: **DiffusionGemma is a latency optimization, not a capability upgrade.** Adopt it the way you would adopt a smaller distilled model — when you have measured that a specific task is latency-bound and tolerates the quality hit, not as a blanket replacement. If you cannot point at a token-budget or a p95-latency number that this fixes, you do not need it yet.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'How I would ship DiffusionGemma in production',
      content: `If I were wiring this into a real product tomorrow, here is the architecture I would actually build — the part the README and the launch blogs will not hand you.

**Route, do not replace.** I would put DiffusionGemma behind the same gateway as my other models and route to it *per task type*, not globally. Inline edits, autocomplete, structured/constrained generation → DiffusionGemma. Open-ended reasoning, final-answer generation, agent planning → a quality-first autoregressive model. A thin router that keys on task type is 30 lines; a global swap is a regression waiting to happen. This is the same multi-model routing pattern I lay out in [OpenRouter vs LiteLLM vs Portkey for an India MVP](/en/notes/openrouter-vs-litellm-vs-portkey-india-mvp-2026).

**Tune the denoising/concurrency knobs for *your* p95, not the benchmark.** Those 700 tok/s figures are best-case at low concurrency. Under real traffic, throughput and quality both shift with \`--max-num-seqs\` and block size. Load-test with your own prompts and watch p95 latency and VRAM together — the failure mode I would worry about is VRAM thrash under a concurrency spike silently dropping you back below your latency target.

**Add an output validator, because diffusion can produce subtly malformed blocks.** Parallel generation occasionally commits a block that is locally confident but globally wrong — a half-closed JSON brace, a constraint quietly violated. For any structured output I would gate it behind a schema validator and a cheap autoregressive fallback on failure, rather than trusting the block.

**Keep it on-device where the privacy story sells.** The most compelling place I would deploy this is an **offline-first feature** — on-device rewriting, local code assist, an app that works on a plane — where 18GB + 700 tok/s means no data leaves the device. On-device AI (Gemma, LiteRT, offline-first) is a stack I work in directly, and a fast, Apache-2.0, edge-sized diffusion model is a genuinely new tool for it. The integration that bites you will not be the model load — it will be memory pressure on a shared device and graceful degradation when the model is not resident. Budget for that, not for the happy path.`,
