When a founder gets two MVP quotes — a $20K 6-week sprint from a senior contractor and an $80K 3-month build from an agency — the assumption is the agency build is "more serious" and the sprint is "scrappy". The reality from 30+ MVPs I have observed: the 6-week sprint ships in 6 weeks 90% of the time, and the 3-month agency build ships in 18-24 weeks 70% of the time.

Engineer talent is not the difference. The senior at the agency is good. The contractor is good. Both write production code. The difference is contract structure: the sprint is fixed-scope and the agency build is hourly-or-monthly with a soft scope. That single structural difference produces a 3x time difference in shipping speed.

This post is the honest comparison. Where each model wins, where each fails, and how to pick the right one for your specific MVP.`

      content: `Three structural reasons agency MVPs slip:

**1. Soft scope plus stakeholder feedback equals scope creep.** Agencies typically write a high-level statement of work, then collect detailed requirements during a "discovery phase." Discovery becomes a moving target as founders see early designs and react. Each "small change" in week 2 adds 3-5 days. By week 6, the project is 3 weeks behind.

**2. Multiple-engineer staffing.** Agencies staff projects with 2-3 engineers. Coordination cost is real: code reviews, merge conflicts, knowledge transfer when one engineer is on PTO, design discussions. A 3-engineer project does not ship 3x faster than a 1-engineer project. It ships 1.5-2x faster, with 2x the coordination overhead.

**3. Account management ceremony.** Weekly status meetings, monthly stakeholder reviews, quarterly business reviews — for a 3-month project, this is 8-12 hours of recurring meetings. Each meeting is a context switch for the engineering team. By month 2, the team is half-velocity because every Monday is consumed by status updates.

This is not the agency being negligent. It is the contract structure rewarding consultative behavior over shipping behavior. The agency gets paid by the hour or by the month — long projects are good for agency revenue. Founders should not blame the agency; they should change the contract structure.`

    {
      heading: 'Why "6 Weeks" Actually Ships in 6 Weeks',
      content: `Three structural reasons sprint MVPs ship on time:

**1. Fixed scope locked on day one.** The 1-page scope doc is signed before code is written. Mid-sprint additions are swaps (drop one feature, add another of equivalent effort) or v2 sprints. There is no "small addition" lane. This is brutal but it is the entire reason the sprint works.

**2. Single senior engineer, no coordination tax.** One person owns the entire codebase. No code reviews, no merge conflicts, no design discussions, no knowledge transfer. The engineer makes decisions and ships code. Velocity is 100% — every hour spent on the project is shipping work.

**3. Founder-to-engineer direct communication.** No PM, no account manager. Founder pings engineer on Slack with feedback. Engineer ships fix in 2 hours. Loop tightness is measured in hours, not weeks. The founder feels the velocity because they are part of the development cycle.

These three structural choices are the entire moat of the 6-week sprint model. Any senior engineer with a fixed-scope contract and a direct founder relationship can ship in 6 weeks. The hard part is convincing founders to commit to fixed scope before they have seen a UI.`

    {
      heading: 'The Real Cost Comparison Over 6 Months',
      content: `If your MVP launches in 6 weeks, you have 4.5 more months of runway to talk to users, iterate, and ship v2. If your MVP launches in 5 months, you have 1 month of runway left after a typical 6-month seed deployment plan. Time-to-launch is not just a feature speed metric — it is a runway extender.

| Scenario | Sprint ($22K) | Agency ($87K) |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Cash spent | $22K | $87K |
| Weeks to launch | 6 | 14 (planned) / 22 (actual) |
| Cash remaining at month 3 | $X | $X - $65K |
| User feedback by month 6 | 4 months of feedback | 1 month of feedback |
| v2 budget available | $40-60K leftover | $0 leftover (often need bridge round) |

The compounding effect: a sprint that ships at week 6 collects 3-4 months of real user feedback before the agency MVP ships. Founder learning compounds. The sprint v2 (built on real user feedback) is sharper than the agency v1 (built on founder hypotheses). By month 9, the sprint product is 2 versions ahead of the agency product.

This is why 36% of solo-founded startups in 2026 use the sprint model. They do not have the runway for a 5-month agency build. The math forces the structural choice.`

      heading: 'When the 3-Month Agency Build Actually Wins',
      content: `Three scenarios where I would tell a founder to take the agency quote:

**1. Your MVP requires 3+ engineers in parallel.** If your scope is genuinely 3-engineer-sized — for example, a marketplace with two separate apps (buyer + seller) plus an admin panel plus integrations — a single contractor cannot deliver in 6 weeks. An agency can staff a team. Take the agency quote.

**2. You have an enterprise customer with a hard contractual deadline.** If your MVP must ship by a specific date with specific features (signed in a contract with a customer or investor), the agency model with PM oversight reduces single-point-of-failure risk. A contractor going on a 1-week emergency leave breaks the timeline. An agency rebalances staffing.

**3. You need post-launch SLAs and 24/7 support.** If your product is mission-critical (B2B SaaS for healthcare, fintech, or compliance) and needs round-the-clock incident response from day 1, an agency with a support team is the right fit. Contractors typically work in business hours.

For everything else — pre-seed B2B SaaS, consumer products, founder-led validation builds, internal tools — the sprint model wins on time, cost, and learning velocity.

I've written the deeper version of this argument in [What a $15K MVP Actually Includes](/en/notes/what-15k-mvp-actually-includes-vs-50k-agency-quote) and the contrarian counter-take in [Drizzle vs Prisma vs TypeORM](/en/notes/drizzle-vs-prisma-vs-typeorm-india-mvp-2026).`

      heading: 'How to Pick: The 5-Minute Decision Tree',
      content: `Run through these five questions:

1. **Is your scope ≤ 5 core features + auth + billing + 2-3 integrations?** If yes → sprint. If no → agency.
2. **Can you commit to fixed scope on day one?** If yes → sprint. If "we will figure it out as we go" → agency.
3. **Do you have a hard external deadline non-negotiable?** If yes → agency (more redundancy). If no → sprint (faster).
4. **Will you talk to users post-launch and iterate?** If yes → sprint (more runway). If no → either works.
5. **Is your runway under 12 months?** If yes → sprint (cash matters). If no → either works.

If you answered "sprint" to 3+ questions, take the sprint quote. If you answered "agency" to 3+ questions, take the agency quote. If it is mixed, the deciding factor is: do you trust yourself to lock scope on day one. If yes, sprint. If no, agency.
