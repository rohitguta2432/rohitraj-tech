As of **June 12, 2026**, the most-starred AI coding agent on GitHub is not Claude Code, not Cursor, and not OpenAI's Codex CLI — it is **OpenCode**, sitting at **172,198 stars** under an MIT license ([Morph LLM's June rankings](https://www.morphllm.com/ai-coding-agent)). It shipped **v1.17.4 today**, and LogRocket's June power rankings called it the first major shake-up in the coding-agent category since Cursor's last rebuild.

The capability that changed is not a benchmark number — it is **decoupling the harness from the model**. Claude Code only drives Anthropic models; Codex CLI is built around GPT; Cursor pushes you toward its own Composer line. OpenCode does the opposite: it is a free, open agent loop, and you bring your own brain — Claude, GPT-5.5, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, or a local model on Ollama. That single design choice is why it crossed 160K stars in under a year and now reports roughly **7.5M monthly active developers**.

This is the developer-only read, not a feature-list reprint. The three tools are not really competing for the same job, and the star count flatters OpenCode in a way the benchmarks complicate. Below: what OpenCode actually is, how to install and wire it, the Terminal-Bench numbers that matter, an honest comparison table against Claude Code and Cursor, when to skip OpenCode, and how I would put it into a production team without the cost-and-security surprises the README leaves out.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'What is OpenCode, and why did it hit 172K stars?',
      content: `OpenCode (the [sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) project) brands itself plainly: "the open source AI coding agent." It runs as a terminal UI and a desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux, and ships **two built-in agents** — a **build** agent with full read/write/run access and a **plan** agent that is read-only for safe exploration. There is also a general subagent for multi-step searches, the same pattern the managed tools use.

The star lead is real and recent. As of June 2026 the open-source coding-agent leaderboard reads: **OpenCode 172,198 (MIT)**, then **Gemini CLI at 105,104 (Apache-2.0)** and **OpenAI Codex CLI at 89,991 (Apache-2.0)**; Claude Code's repo sits around **131,000** but the tool itself is proprietary (the repo is mostly for issues) ([Morph LLM](https://www.morphllm.com/ai-coding-agent)). OpenCode **launched in June 2025**, so 172K stars represents one year of growth — the fastest any coding agent has climbed.

The newest thing worth knowing is **Desktop v2**, shipped as **v1.15.11 on May 27, 2026**: a redesigned home screen, titlebar session controls, pinch-zoom, and — the one that matters for agent workflows — **background agents that push updates without polling** ([AI Builder Club](https://www.aibuilderclub.com/blog/opencode-vs-claude-code-2026)). That is OpenCode answering Claude Code's managed background-agent features with an open equivalent. Today's **v1.17.4** is an incremental follow-on; the platform is shipping multiple releases a week, which is itself a signal of momentum.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'How do you install and configure OpenCode?',
      content: `Installation is a one-liner, and the configuration is where the model-agnostic pitch becomes concrete. Install:

\`\`\`bash
# Official installer (macOS / Linux / WSL)
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# or via npm
npm i -g opencode-ai@latest

# then, in any repo:
opencode
\`\`\`

The interesting part is per-agent model routing. Because OpenCode is BYOK across 75+ providers, you can run a cheap or local model for the read-only **plan** agent and a frontier model only for the **build** agent that actually writes code — so you are not paying GPT-5.5 rates to grep your repo:

\`\`\`jsonc
// opencode.jsonc
{
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": { "apiKey": "{env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}" },
    "ollama":    { "baseURL": "http://localhost:11434/v1" }
  },
  "agent": {
    "plan":  { "model": "ollama/qwen3-coder:7b" },   // local, $0 — exploration
    "build": { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-8" } // frontier — writes code
  }
}
\`\`\`

That split is the whole point. The agent loop — the prompt scaffolding, tool calls, diff application, LSP feedback — is free and identical no matter which model answers. You decide where to spend. Swapping \`claude-opus-4-8\` for \`openai/gpt-5.5\` or a local model is a one-line change, not a tool migration. If you already think about model spend across providers, this slots straight into the [OpenRouter vs LiteLLM vs Portkey routing setup](/en/notes/openrouter-vs-litellm-vs-portkey-india-mvp-2026) I use for the same reason.`,

      heading: 'Where does OpenCode actually shine?',
      content: `Three concrete places it beats the managed alternatives.

**1. Cost control, down to zero.** OpenCode is a free tool; you pay only for the tokens your chosen model consumes, and with a local model on Ollama that is **$0** ([AI Builder Club](https://www.aibuilderclub.com/blog/opencode-vs-claude-code-2026)). Compare that to Claude Code (~$17–20/mo, Max from $100/mo) or Cursor ($20/$60/$200 per month). For a solo dev, an indie hacker, or a small India-based team watching every dollar of runway, "the harness is free, you only pay for inference you control" is a materially different economics than a per-seat subscription.

**2. Model-agnostic means you inherit the best benchmark, not a vendor's.** On **Terminal-Bench 2.1**, **Codex CLI + GPT-5.5 leads at 83.4%**, with **Claude Code + Opus 4.8 at 78.9%** ([Morph LLM](https://www.morphllm.com/ai-coding-agent)). OpenCode has no fixed score of its own — and that is the feature, not a gap. Plug GPT-5.5 into OpenCode's build agent and you inherit roughly Codex-tier capability **without** being locked to ChatGPT's $20/mo wrapper; plug Opus 4.8 in and you get Claude Code's brain without the Anthropic-only constraint. You are buying a harness and renting the intelligence separately.

**3. Open source, LSP, and auditability.** OpenCode integrates with the **Language Server Protocol**, feeding real compiler and type diagnostics back to the model so fixes are grounded in what the toolchain actually reports — not the model's guess. Being MIT-licensed and self-hostable also matters for regulated teams: you can read the agent loop, sandbox it, and run it fully offline with a local model. That is the same instinct behind shipping an [AI vulnerability scanner you actually control](/en/notes/claude-ai-vulnerability-scanner-2026) rather than trusting a black box.`,

      heading: 'OpenCode vs Claude Code vs Cursor: the comparison table',
      content: `The key insight before you read this: these three are **not the same category**. OpenCode and Claude Code are terminal-first agents; Cursor is a full IDE. The star count makes OpenCode look like the runaway winner, but Claude Code's managed features and Cursor's GUI solve problems OpenCode deliberately leaves to you.

    },
    {
      heading: 'When should you skip OpenCode?',
      content: `The 172K stars hide three honest reasons to stay on Claude Code or Cursor.

**You lose Claude Code's managed agentic layer.** Claude Code ships features OpenCode has no equivalent for: Agent View, \`/goal\` completion conditions, \`/ultrareview\` bug hunting, Ultraplan, Routines, mobile notifications, and computer use, all wired into Anthropic's stack ([AI Builder Club](https://www.aibuilderclub.com/blog/opencode-vs-claude-code-2026)). If your workflow leans on managed background agents or cloud-side features — the kind I lean on for [dynamic multi-agent Claude Code workflows](/en/notes/claude-code-dynamic-workflows-guide-2026) — OpenCode asks you to rebuild that yourself.

**BYOK means you own the cost and security surface.** "Free harness, bring your own key" also means there is no vendor putting guardrails between an autonomous agent and your shell, your filesystem, and 75 different API endpoints. A managed tool absorbs some of that risk; OpenCode hands it to you. That is fine — preferable, even — if you sandbox it, but it is not a default-safe experience.

**LSP and local models only pay off on mainstream stacks.** The LSP feedback loop is only as good as your language's language server, and a local model at $0 is only useful if your hardware can run one strong enough to be worth it. On a niche language or a laptop without a GPU, two of OpenCode's three headline advantages thin out — and Codex CLI's **83.4%** or Cursor's IDE polish may serve you better. If you want a GUI with AI woven into the editor rather than a terminal agent at all, Cursor is simply a different and valid answer.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'How I would ship OpenCode in production',
      content: `If a client asked me to put OpenCode in front of a team this week, here is the wiring I would insist on — the parts that are not in the quickstart.

**Route by agent, not by vibe.** Use the per-agent model config to send the read-only **plan** agent to a cheap or local model and reserve a frontier model for the **build** agent. This is the cheapest reliable way to keep an autonomous loop from burning frontier tokens on exploration. It is the same principle as harness-engineering: the [agent-first methodology OpenAI documented for Codex](/en/notes/what-is-harness-engineering-codex-2026) lives or dies on routing and guardrails, not on raw model strength.

**Sandbox the build agent.** An open agent with shell access and write permissions is a real attack surface, especially once it is pulling context from issues, PRs, or web pages an attacker can influence. I would run the build agent in a container or a disposable worktree, scope its filesystem and network, and never let it touch production credentials. The failure mode the README never warns about is not a bad diff — it is a prompt-injected agent running a command you did not write.

**Cap spend per environment.** BYOK with 75 providers makes it trivially easy to point an overnight agent at a $50/M-output model and wake up to a four-figure bill. Set a hard monthly token ceiling per key and alert on drift, exactly as I argued for routing around the [Claude Fable 5 fallback and retention rules](/en/notes/claude-fable-5-developer-guide-2026).

This is the routing-cost-and-sandbox layer I wire in from commit one when I [build an MVP in 6 weeks](/en/services/6-week-mvp) — agent choice behind a clean interface, cost caps, and a sandbox, so swapping models or locking the agent down is a config change, not a rewrite.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'OpenCode FAQ',
      content: `**Is OpenCode free?** Yes. OpenCode is an open-source (MIT) tool with no subscription — you install it for free and pay only for the model tokens you consume, or **$0** if you run a local model on Ollama ([AI Builder Club](https://www.aibuilderclub.com/blog/opencode-vs-claude-code-2026)).

**Is OpenCode better than Claude Code?** It depends on what you weight. OpenCode wins on openness, cost, and model choice (172K stars, MIT, 75+ providers). Claude Code wins on managed features — Agent View, /ultrareview, Routines, computer use — and on a guaranteed top-tier model (78.9% on Terminal-Bench 2.1 with Opus 4.8). For raw benchmark, Codex CLI + GPT-5.5 leads at 83.4% — and you can run GPT-5.5 *inside* OpenCode.

**What models does OpenCode support?** Any of 75+ providers via BYOK, including Claude, OpenAI (GPT-5.5), Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, and local models through Ollama. It also has an official GitHub Copilot integration.

**Can OpenCode use local models?** Yes — point it at a local Ollama endpoint and run fully offline at zero API cost. This is one of its biggest advantages over Claude Code and Cursor, neither of which run local models.

**Is OpenCode safe to use?** The agent loop is open and auditable, but BYOK means there is no managed vendor guardrail between the build agent and your shell. Treat it like any tool with code-execution rights: sandbox it, scope its permissions, and keep production credentials out of reach.

**Is OpenCode the same as Cursor?** No. Cursor is a full IDE (a VS Code fork) with AI at the center of a GUI editor; OpenCode is a terminal-first agent plus a lightweight desktop app. Different category, different ergonomics.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'The verdict for developers',
      content: `OpenCode earning the #1 star spot is not hype — it reflects a genuine architectural bet: **make the agent loop free and open, and let the developer own the model.** That decoupling is why it can match Codex's benchmark (run GPT-5.5), match Claude Code's brain (run Opus 4.8), or cost nothing (run local), all from one MIT-licensed harness. The catch is equally real: you forfeit Claude Code's managed agentic features and you inherit the cost and security surface a subscription would otherwise absorb.

So the honest 2026 answer to "which AI coding agent is best" is a routing decision, not a winner: **OpenCode** if you value openness, cost control, and model choice and will do the sandboxing yourself; **Claude Code** if you want the managed, batteries-included experience; **Cursor** if you want a GUI IDE. Most power users keep more than one installed and switch by task.

If you want an AI coding workflow set up so the agent, the model, and the cost caps are all swappable and sandboxed from the first commit — instead of hard-wiring one tool and discovering the bill and the attack surface in production — that is the work I do. I ship [production MVPs in 6 weeks](/en/services/6-week-mvp) and take [founding-engineer engagements for India-based teams](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) building on the current agent stack.`,
