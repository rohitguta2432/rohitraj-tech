      content: `Pick **LangGraph** if your agent has more than one branch, needs human-in-the-loop, or will hit production users — it is the only one of the three with proper state persistence and deterministic replay. Pick **CrewAI** for a 2–4 agent prototype you will throw away in 30 days; it is the fastest path from idea to demo. Avoid **AutoGen** for India MVPs in 2026 unless you have Azure credits to burn — the two-agent chat pattern eats 3–5× more tokens than LangGraph for the same task, and the v0.4 rewrite broke half the tutorials on the public web.

Skip multi-agent entirely if a single GPT-4o call with three tool definitions does the job. Most "agent apps" do not need agents.`,

If you are picking a multi-agent framework for an India MVP in 2026, the honest answer is LangGraph for anything that will see real users, CrewAI for a 30-day prototype, and AutoGen almost never. I have shipped agent systems on all three across four client projects in the last 18 months — a Sanskrit-to-SQL RAG pipeline ([rag-for-sql](/en/projects)), an enterprise deal-matching engine on Spring Boot, an on-device scam detector, and a finance research assistant inside [myFinancial](/en). The frameworks are not equivalent; they fail in very different ways at very different price points.

The cost math nobody runs before they start is this: a two-agent CrewAI loop on GPT-4o that retries 3 times on a malformed JSON output burns roughly 18,000 tokens per user request. At ₹0.85 per 1K input tokens, that is ₹15.30 per request. A LangGraph state machine doing the same work with a structured-output node and one retry burns 4,500 tokens — about ₹3.80. At 200 requests per day, that is the difference between ₹2,280 per month and ₹9,180 per month in pure inference cost, before infra. India MVPs die on this kind of math.

This post is the comparison I wish I had read before I burned ₹40,000 of OpenAI credits debugging an AutoGen two-agent chat that would not stop talking to itself. Real cost numbers, real failure modes, and a 5-step decision tree at the end. If you would rather skip the framework lottery, a [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp) starts at LangGraph by default — but read on if you want to make the call yourself.`,

      heading: 'What Each Framework Actually Does in 2026',
      content: `Before the comparison, what each thing is — because the marketing pages all say "build production-ready multi-agent systems" and none of them mean the same thing.

**LangGraph** is a state-machine library on top of LangChain. You define nodes (functions or LLM calls), edges (transitions), and shared state. It compiles to a graph you can checkpoint, resume, replay, and visualise. As of v0.2.50 it ships with built-in Postgres and SQLite persistence, human-in-the-loop interrupts, and time-travel debugging. It is the most boring of the three, which in production is exactly what you want.

**CrewAI** is a higher-level abstraction where you define agents with roles ("Researcher", "Writer"), tasks, and a Crew that runs them sequentially or hierarchically. The mental model is a team of humans. Version 0.86 added Flows, which is essentially a graph layer that admits CrewAI tried to skip too much. The original sequential mode is still the fastest way to build a 3-agent demo in 200 lines.

**AutoGen** is Microsoft Research's two-agent conversational pattern — a UserProxy and an Assistant talking until a termination condition fires. v0.4 (Nov 2024) rewrote the entire core to an async event-driven model called AgentChat, breaking compatibility with v0.2. Most blog tutorials on the public web still reference v0.2 APIs that no longer exist. The library is technically excellent and almost impossible to learn from documentation alone in 2026.

| Framework | First commit | Latest major | Mental model | Killer feature |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| LangGraph | Jan 2024 | v0.2.50 (Apr 2026) | State machine | Postgres checkpointer + replay |
| CrewAI | Oct 2023 | v0.86 (Mar 2026) | Team of roles | Sequential crew in 200 lines |
| AutoGen | Sep 2023 | v0.4 (Nov 2024 rewrite) | Two-agent chat | Code execution sandbox |

The frameworks are not competing on the same axis. LangGraph competes with Temporal and Inngest more than it competes with CrewAI. CrewAI competes with a clever prompt. AutoGen competes with itself.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Real Cost on a 200-User India MVP — The Number That Decides',
      content: `I rebuilt the same task — extract structured data from a 4-page PDF, validate it against a Postgres schema, and write a summary email — three times, once on each framework, on GPT-4o. Same input, same target output, same retry logic. Here is what 200 user runs cost:

| Framework | Tokens per run | Cost per run (₹) | 200 runs/day cost (₹/month) | Latency p95 (s) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| LangGraph | 4,500 | 3.80 | 2,280 | 6.2 |
| CrewAI (sequential) | 11,200 | 9.50 | 5,700 | 14.8 |
| CrewAI (hierarchical) | 17,400 | 14.80 | 8,880 | 22.1 |
| AutoGen (UserProxy + Assistant) | 18,300 | 15.55 | 9,330 | 19.4 |

LangGraph wins on tokens for one structural reason — it does not need a manager agent. The graph itself is the manager. CrewAI hierarchical and AutoGen both spend a meaningful fraction of every run on an LLM call that exists only to decide which other LLM call to make next. That manager call alone can be 2K–4K tokens per run, and it scales linearly with task complexity.

For an India MVP where 200 daily active users is a real milestone, the difference between ₹2,280 and ₹9,330 per month is not academic. It is two months of your VPS bill on [Hetzner](/en/notes/vercel-vs-railway-vs-hetzner-india-mvp-hosting-2026). I have watched two founders kill perfectly good products by picking the wrong agent framework and running out of runway 3 months ahead of plan.

One caveat: this benchmark assumes the task fits cleanly in a graph. If your problem genuinely requires open-ended conversation between agents — like negotiation, debate, or iterative critique — AutoGen's two-agent loop is the right primitive and the token cost is the price of the work. The mistake is using AutoGen for tasks that have a known structure.`,

    {
      heading: 'Production Failure Modes I Have Hit on Each',
      content: `The marketing pages do not list the failure modes. Eighteen months of shipping has produced this list.

**LangGraph in production** has one real failure mode — the checkpointer Postgres table grows fast. On the rag-for-sql project we hit 2.4 GB of \`checkpoints\` rows in 6 weeks at 800 daily runs. The fix is a TTL job that deletes checkpoints older than 7 days. Once that is in place, the framework is genuinely boring. Deterministic replay has saved 3 production incidents this year alone — being able to rerun the exact state that caused a malformed output is the single most valuable feature any agent framework offers.

**CrewAI in production** breaks in two predictable places. First, agents do not respect token limits on their context — a Researcher agent will happily stuff 80K tokens of scraped web content into the next agent's prompt and crash on GPT-4o's 128K context cap. The fix is manual context truncation in your task description, which defeats half the point of using a "team of agents" abstraction. Second, the sequential crew has no failure recovery — if agent 3 of 5 fails, the entire crew restarts from agent 1. I have logged ₹8,400 of wasted tokens on a single deal-matching crew run that failed at step 4 and re-ran 1–3 unnecessarily.

**AutoGen in production** breaks in one spectacular way — the two-agent chat does not always know when to stop. The default termination is "TERMINATE" in the message text, which the model will forget to emit roughly 8% of the time. The chat then loops until the max-turn limit (default 10) and burns 5–7× the expected token budget. On the myFinancial research assistant prototype I once watched two AutoGen agents have a 47-turn argument about whether a number was a percentage or a basis point. That run cost ₹312. I switched to LangGraph the next morning.

The pattern: LangGraph fails on operational concerns you can fix with a TTL job. CrewAI fails on abstractions that hide the prompt. AutoGen fails on the loop you cannot easily bound.`,

      heading: 'Side-by-Side: What to Actually Pick',
      content: `Here is the decision matrix I now use on every new client project. The columns are not feature checklists — they are the four things that decide whether you ship.

| What you need | LangGraph | CrewAI | AutoGen |
|---------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 2-agent demo in a weekend | Overkill | **Best fit** | Possible |
| Production with 100+ DAU | **Best fit** | Risky | Risky |
| Token budget under ₹3,000/month | **Best fit** | Tight | No |
| Human-in-the-loop approval step | **Built-in** | Hacky | Built-in (v0.4) |
| Deterministic replay of a failed run | **Built-in** | No | No |
| Open-ended agent debate | Verbose | OK | **Best fit** |
| Hiring an engineer to maintain it | **Easiest** | Easy | Hardest |
| Tutorials work on current version | Mostly yes | Mostly yes | **Mostly no** |
| Vendor lock-in to one cloud | Low | Low | Medium (Azure tilt) |

The honest summary: LangGraph wins 7 out of 9 categories for India MVP work. CrewAI wins on weekend speed. AutoGen wins on one specific shape of problem — open-ended multi-agent conversation — that most founders do not actually have.

If you have not built an agent system before, the temptation is to pick CrewAI because its examples are the cleanest. That is the right call for a hackathon. It is the wrong call for anything you plan to charge money for in 90 days. The abstraction that makes CrewAI fast to start is the same abstraction that makes it hard to debug at 2 AM when a single agent decides to ignore your task description.`,

    {
      heading: 'When the Simpler Choice Wins — Skip Multi-Agent Entirely',
      content: `The framework comparison assumes you need multi-agent at all. Most of the time you do not. Before picking LangGraph or CrewAI, run this check.

If your problem can be expressed as "one LLM call with 3–5 tool definitions and one retry loop", you do not need an agent framework. You need [structured outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) and a 40-line Python file. I have shipped 6 production AI features in the last year that founders initially wanted as "multi-agent systems" and that ran perfectly well as a single function-calling LLM call. The decision tree:

1. **Can one prompt + structured output solve it?** → Skip frameworks. Use the OpenAI SDK directly.
2. **Do you need 2–4 distinct steps with different prompts?** → Single LLM with a switch statement, or LangGraph if state matters.
3. **Do you need branching logic that depends on intermediate results?** → LangGraph.
4. **Do you genuinely need agents to negotiate or critique each other?** → AutoGen for the conversation, LangGraph to orchestrate the wrapper.
5. **Is this a 14-day prototype that ships to a single demo?** → CrewAI sequential.

The Lovable and Bolt.new generation of founders has been trained to think "agentic" means "production-grade". It does not. Most agent apps in 2026 that survive past the seed round are 80% prompt engineering, 15% retrieval, and 5% orchestration. The 5% is where the framework choice matters, and even there the wrong pick costs you token budget rather than the product. Get the 80% and 15% right first.

If you cannot tell which side of this you are on, that is exactly the conversation a [founding engineer](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) is for. Most agent architecture decisions take 90 minutes of whiteboarding to settle — far cheaper than learning by burning credits.`,
    },
    {
      heading: '5-Step Decision Tree for Your Next Agent Project',
      content: `Print this. Apply in order. Stop at the first match.

1. **Will this ship to real users within 12 weeks?** If no, use CrewAI. The throwaway speed is worth it for prototypes.
2. **Does the task have a known structure (input → steps → output)?** If yes, use LangGraph. State machines beat conversations for known workflows.
3. **Will the agent ever need human approval mid-run?** If yes, use LangGraph. Interrupts are first-class; in CrewAI they are bolted on.
4. **Is the core problem open-ended dialogue between agents?** If yes, use AutoGen's AgentChat — but only after pinning to v0.4+ and ignoring every pre-2025 tutorial.
5. **Is your token budget under ₹3,000 per month at expected scale?** If yes, use LangGraph or skip multi-agent entirely. CrewAI hierarchical and AutoGen will eat the budget.

A sixth implicit step: if you are not sure, default to LangGraph. The worst case with LangGraph is verbosity. The worst case with CrewAI is silent token bleed. The worst case with AutoGen is a 47-turn agent argument about basis points.`,

If you would rather not learn this by burning ₹40K of OpenAI credits, two ways to skip the lottery:

- **[6-Week MVP Sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp)** — fixed scope, fixed price, LangGraph + Postgres + structured-output stack by default, ships a production agent app in 6 weeks.
- **[Hire a Founding Engineer in India](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india)** — month-to-month senior engineer who has shipped agent systems on all three frameworks and will tell you which one is wrong for your problem before you write a line of code.

Either way, the rule is the same: pick LangGraph for production, CrewAI for prototypes, AutoGen almost never. Save the ₹40K of credits for something that matters — like more users.`,
