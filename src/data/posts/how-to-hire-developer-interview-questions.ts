To hire a good software developer, ask for live project demos, question their tech stack reasoning, verify their deployment and security approach, and insist on milestone-based payments. The 10 questions below filter out unreliable developers before you sign a contract — whether you are technical or not. Focus on evidence of shipped products, clear communication, and a structured work process.

Non-technical founders get burned by developers all the time. The pattern is always the same: you find someone on Upwork or through a referral, they seem competent, you agree on a price, and then three months later you have a half-built app, an empty bank account, and no source code.

I'm a freelance developer telling you how to evaluate freelance developers. Yes, this is self-serving — but I'd rather compete against higher standards than race to the bottom.

Here are the 10 questions I wish every client asked me before signing. The good developers will have clear answers. The bad ones will dodge.`
    },
    {
      heading: 'What Questions Should You Ask Before Hiring a Developer?',
      content: `**1. "Can you show me 2-3 live projects you built?"**
Not mockups. Not designs. Live, working software that real people use. If they can't show you something live, they haven't shipped. Ask for URLs and poke around — does the app actually work? Is it fast?

**2. "What tech stack will you use and why?"**
The answer should reference YOUR requirements, not their preferences. "I'll use React because your app needs fast, interactive UI and it's easy to hire React developers later" is a good answer. "I always use React" is a bad answer.

**3. "How will you handle authentication and security?"**
This is a trap question. If they say "I'll build it myself," run. Authentication should use a battle-tested service (Clerk, Supabase Auth, Auth0). Any developer building custom auth in 2026 is either inexperienced or reckless.

**4. "What's your deployment plan?"**
They should mention: hosting provider, CI/CD pipeline, environment management (dev/staging/prod), and monitoring. If they say "I'll deploy it to a server," ask which server, how, and who monitors it at 2 AM.

**5. "How will we communicate during the project?"**
Weekly updates are the minimum. I do weekly video demos on Friday. They should propose a specific cadence, not just "we'll stay in touch."

**How to evaluate answers when you are not technical:** You do not need to understand the code to evaluate a developer. Pay attention to how they explain things. A strong developer simplifies complex topics without being condescending. If they use jargon without explaining it, that is how they will communicate during the project. Also ask them to walk you through one of their live projects as if you were a user. Watch how they describe the user experience versus the technical implementation. Developers who think about users build better products than developers who only think about code.`
    },
    {
      heading: 'Questions 6-10',
      content: `**6. "What happens if you get hit by a bus?"**
Morbid, but essential. Where is the code? Who else can access it? Is it in a private GitHub repo that you own, or on their personal machine? Your code should live in YOUR GitHub/GitLab organization from day one.

**7. "How do you handle scope changes?"**
The right answer is a change request process with cost estimates before work begins. "We'll figure it out" means they'll either overcharge you later or cut corners to stay within the original budget.

**8. "What's your testing strategy?"**
At minimum: manual testing of critical flows before each release. Better: automated tests for business logic. If they look confused when you ask about testing, that's your answer.

**9. "Can you walk me through the architecture of your last project?"**
This separates developers who build from developers who copy tutorials. They should explain their decisions clearly — why they chose certain technologies, what trade-offs they made, what they'd do differently.

**10. "What's your payment structure?"**
Red flags: 100% upfront, hourly with no cap, vague milestones. Good structure: milestone-based payments tied to deliverables. My structure: 30% upfront, 30% at midpoint demo, 40% at delivery and deployment.`
    },
    {
      heading: 'What Are the Red Flags and Green Flags When Hiring a Developer?',
      content: `**Green flags:**
- Portfolio of live, working projects (not just screenshots)
- Clear communication — responds within 24 hours, writes coherently
- Asks YOU questions about the business problem before talking about technology
- Provides a written proposal with scope, timeline, and cost breakdown
- Uses version control (Git) and gives you repository access from day one
- Has a contract that protects both sides

**Red flags:**
- "I can build anything in any language" — Generalists rarely ship quality
- No portfolio or only Figma mockups — If they haven't shipped, they can't ship yours
- Won't show code samples — Why not?
- Quotes without asking questions — If they price your project in 5 minutes, they don't understand it
- No contract or milestone structure — Protect both sides
- Disappears for days without updates — This will only get worse during the project

**Price expectations in India (2026):**
- Junior freelancer: ₹500-1,500/hour
- Mid-level freelancer: ₹1,500-3,500/hour
- Senior freelancer (5+ years, portfolio): ₹3,500-7,000/hour
- Agency: ₹5,000-15,000/hour (but you're paying for overhead)

If someone quotes dramatically below market rate, they're either desperate or lying about their experience. Both are bad.

**The trial project approach:** Before committing to a full project, consider hiring your developer for a small paid trial task — a $500-$1,500 feature or fix that takes a week. This tells you more than any interview. You learn how they communicate, how they handle ambiguity, whether they deliver on time, and whether their code quality matches their claims. The cost of a trial is trivial compared to the cost of hiring the wrong developer for a $15,000 project. I always welcome trial projects because they build trust on both sides.`

    {
      heading: 'How I Handle These Questions',
      content: `I'll answer my own questions so you know what good answers look like:

1. **Live projects:** rohitraj.tech/projects — ClinIQ AI, StellarMIND, SanatanApp, myFinancial, MicroItinerary. All live.
2. **Tech stack:** I recommend based on requirements. Spring Boot for complex backends, Next.js for web apps, React Native for mobile.
3. **Auth:** Supabase Auth or Clerk. Never custom.
4. **Deployment:** AWS Amplify or Vercel with CI/CD from GitHub. Staging + production environments.
5. **Communication:** Weekly Friday demos via video call. WhatsApp/Slack for async.
6. **Bus factor:** Code lives in your GitHub org. I document architecture decisions in the README.
7. **Scope changes:** Written change request with cost estimate. Approved before work begins.
8. **Testing:** Integration tests for critical paths. Manual QA before each release.
9. **Architecture:** Happy to walk through any project — ask me about ClinIQ AI's RAG pipeline or SanatanApp's offline-first architecture.
10. **Payment:** 30-30-40 milestone structure. Contract signed before work begins.

The goal isn't to find a perfect developer. It's to find one who communicates clearly, ships working software, and doesn't disappear. These 10 questions will filter out 80% of the bad ones.

If you'd rather hand the build off and review weekly, the [founding engineer in India](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) is the fastest path; for a longer-term engineering relationship, look at [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp).

I've written the deeper version of this argument in [How Much Does It Cost to Build a Mobile App in India? Real Numbers from a…](/en/notes/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-mobile-app-india-2026) and the contrarian counter-take in [How to Build a SaaS MVP in 2026](/en/notes/how-to-build-saas-mvp-2026).`
    },
    {
      heading: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
      content: `**Q: How do I evaluate a developer if I am not technical?**

Focus on three things you can verify without technical knowledge: live projects (do their apps actually work when you use them?), communication quality (do they explain decisions clearly and respond promptly?), and references (can they connect you with previous clients?). Ask them to demo a past project and explain what it does as if you were a customer. A developer who cannot explain their work in plain language will struggle to understand your business requirements.

**Q: How much should I pay a freelance developer in India?**

In 2026, junior freelancers charge ₹500-1,500 per hour, mid-level developers charge ₹1,500-3,500 per hour, and senior developers with 5+ years of experience and a strong portfolio charge ₹3,500-7,000 per hour. Agencies charge ₹5,000-15,000 per hour but include overhead you may not need. For project-based pricing, a simple app costs $3,000-$6,000, an MVP costs $7,000-$12,000, and a complex app costs $12,000-$30,000. Always compare total project cost, not hourly rate alone.

**Q: Should I hire a freelancer or an in-house developer?**

For a startup building its first product, a freelancer is almost always the better choice. In-house developers require salaries, benefits, equipment, and management overhead — even when there is no code to write. A senior freelancer can build your MVP in 6-8 weeks, hand over the code, and you hire in-house only when you have enough ongoing work to justify a full-time salary. The break-even point is usually when you need more than 20 hours per week of consistent development work.

**Q: What should be in a freelance developer contract?**

Essential clauses include: scope of work with specific features listed, payment milestones tied to deliverables, timeline with deadlines, intellectual property transfer (you own all code upon payment), confidentiality terms, post-launch support period (typically 2-4 weeks of bug fixes), and a termination clause. Never start work without a signed contract. A good freelancer will have a standard contract ready — if they resist putting terms in writing, that is a significant red flag.

**Q: How do I protect myself from a developer disappearing mid-project?**

Three safeguards: First, ensure code lives in a repository you own from day one — not on the developer's personal account. Second, use milestone-based payments so you never pay for undelivered work. Third, get weekly demos of working software. If you follow these three rules, a developer disappearing costs you at most one week of work and zero source code. The biggest risk factor is paying large amounts upfront without seeing working software first.`
