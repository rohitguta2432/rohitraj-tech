        'Two Hacker News front-page threads this week — one at 1,245 points — are asking the same thing: can a local model finally replace Claude or GPT for daily coding? The honest 2026 answer is "for ~80% of your sessions, yes." Here is the builder read: which local coding models actually crossed the SWE-bench line, how to set one up with Ollama in ten minutes, exactly how much VRAM you need, and the hybrid routing pattern that keeps the hard 20% on the cloud.',

The catch: a **~$500 GPU buys 85–90% of Claude's quality**, and the missing 10–15% is the hard, multi-file, architectural work. So the winning 2026 setup isn't all-local — it's **local for the 80%, cloud for the hard 20%, routed automatically.**`,

This week two threads hit the Hacker News front page within a day of each other and asked the same question from opposite directions. One — "[Has anyone replaced Claude/GPT with a local model for daily coding?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=48542100)" — pulled **1,245 points and 534 comments**. The other, "[Running local models is good now](https://vickiboykis.com/2026/06/15/running-local-models-is-good-now/)", pulled **1,135 points**. When a topic owns two front-page slots in 48 hours, the underlying capability has shifted, not just the discourse.

What shifted is a benchmark line. For two years the standard answer to "is a local model good enough to code with?" was a polite no — fine for autocomplete, useless for real work. That answer is now wrong for most sessions, and the people saying so loudest are developers who tried it on their own hardware and quietly cancelled a subscription.

This is the builder's read, not a leaderboard recap. Below: what actually changed (with the benchmark numbers and the caveats those numbers hide), which local model to run for which job and how much VRAM each needs, a ten-minute setup you can copy, an honest section on the 20% where local still loses, and the hybrid routing pattern I'd ship to a client — the one that turned [today's Claude outage](https://status.claude.com/incidents/xmhsglsz3h3w) from a workday-killer into a non-event for anyone running it.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'What changed: local coding models crossed the SWE-bench line',
            content: `The single number that flipped the verdict is **SWE-bench Verified** — the test where a model has to resolve real GitHub issues in real production repos, not solve toy puzzles. Crossing ~50% on it is the rough threshold where a model stops feeling like a toy and starts closing pull requests.

Through late 2025 and into 2026, the open models cleared it. Per the 2026 roundups, **Qwen3-Coder-Next is quoted at 58.7% SWE-bench Verified with a 256K context window on a single 24 GB GPU**, and on the higher end **Devstral 2 is cited around 72%** ([overchat.ai](https://overchat.ai/ai-hub/best-local-llm-for-coding); [pinggy.io self-hosted guide, updated 2026-06-03](https://pinggy.io/blog/best_open_source_self_hosted_llms_for_coding/)). For comparison, frontier cloud models sit in the high-70s to mid-80s — a real gap, but no longer a chasm.

One honest caveat the leaderboards bury: **self-reported SWE-bench scores swing 5–15 points depending on the scaffold** (the agent harness, retry budget, and test-runner wired around the model). The same weights score differently inside Aider, OpenCode, or a vendor's private harness. Treat any single number as directional, not gospel — which is why the setup and routing below matter more than chasing the top row of a table.

And it is not one lucky model carrying the category. The 2026 self-hosted roundups now list a deep bench — **Kimi K2.6 Thinking, GLM-5.1, DeepSeek V3.2 and V4-Pro, MiniMax M2.5, Qwen 3.6 27B, Devstral 2** — all open-weight and all runnable on a single workstation ([pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io/blog/best_open_source_self_hosted_llms_for_coding/)). When seven or eight independent labs all clear the same bar in a six-month window, the capability is real, not a one-model fluke — and that breadth is exactly what makes "cancel the subscription" a question worth asking out loud.

The structural reason this happened: **a 256K-context, 24 GB-runnable model is a fundamentally different product than a 7B autocomplete model from 2024.** It can hold a real module in context, reason across files, and follow a multi-step instruction. That is the capability that makes the "replace my subscription" question reasonable to ask at all. If you want the model-vs-model detail on the open coding frontier, I went deep on one of them in [Kimi K2.7 Code vs Claude Opus and GPT](/en/notes/kimi-k2-7-code-vs-claude-opus-gpt-2026).`,

            content: `There is no single "best" — there is a best *for your VRAM and your job*. Here is the practical matrix, drawn from the 2026 SWE-bench roundups and the models people are actually running on Ollama. VRAM figures assume a 4-bit quant, which is the sane default for local coding.

| Model | SWE-bench Verified* | Min VRAM (4-bit) | Best for |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|----------|
| **Qwen3-Coder-Next** | ~58.7% | 24 GB | Best all-round; 256K context, whole-module reasoning |
| **Devstral 2** | ~72% | 24–32 GB | Agentic, multi-file edits with a coding harness |
| **DeepSeek V3.2** | reasoning leader | 24 GB+ | Algorithmic / LeetCode-style / data work |
| **Codestral 25.12** | — | 16 GB | Fast inline completion inside VS Code |
| **DeepSeek-Coder V3 (distilled)** | ~40.5% | 12 GB | Best quality-per-GB on modest hardware |
| **Qwen2.5-Coder 32B** | — | 24 GB | The reliable Ollama workhorse |
| **Llama 4 Scout** | — | varies | 10M-token context — paste an entire mid-size repo |

*\\*SWE-bench numbers are self-reported and vary by harness; use them as a starting point, not a ranking.*

The short version for most people: **if you have a 24 GB GPU, install Qwen3-Coder-Next and stop reading.** It is the best balance of capability, context length, and "fits on hardware you can actually buy" in 2026. Codestral 25.12 is the pick if you mostly want fast inline completion and have a 16 GB card; DeepSeek-Coder V3 distilled is the pick if you're on 12 GB. Llama 4 Scout's 10M context is a genuine party trick for whole-repo questions, but you pay for it in latency.`,

            heading: 'How to set up a local coding model with Ollama in ten minutes',
            content: `The reason "local" finally feels easy is that the runtime stopped being the hard part. [Ollama](https://ollama.com) turns a model into a localhost OpenAI-compatible endpoint with two commands, and every serious coding harness — Continue, Aider, OpenCode, even Claude Code via a proxy — can point at that endpoint instead of a cloud API. Here is the whole flow:

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Install Ollama (macOS / Linux), then pull a coding model
ollama pull qwen3-coder-next:latest        # 24 GB GPU
# ollama pull codestral:25.12              # 16 GB card, completion-focused
# ollama pull deepseek-coder-v3:distill    # 12 GB, quality-per-GB pick

# 2. Serve it — Ollama exposes an OpenAI-compatible API on :11434
ollama serve

# 3. Point any OpenAI-compatible tool at it. Example: a raw call
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3-coder-next:latest",
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Refactor this to async/await: ..."}]
  }'
\`\`\`

To wire it into your editor, install the **Continue** extension in VS Code or JetBrains and add the local model to \`config.json\`:

\`\`\`json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Qwen3-Coder (local)",
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model": "qwen3-coder-next:latest",
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:11434"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

That's it — inline completion, chat, and edit-in-place now run on your machine with zero per-token cost. The harness you wrap around the model matters as much as the model itself; I compared the open coding agents in [OpenCode vs Claude Code vs Cursor](/en/notes/opencode-vs-claude-code-cursor-2026) if you want to pick the wrapper before the weights.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'The hardware reality: how much VRAM you actually need',
            content: `This is where the romance meets the invoice. The consensus that emerged across this week's threads is blunt: **24 GB of VRAM is the sweet spot for serious local coding in 2026** — enough to run a 24–32B coding model at a usable quant with room for context ([HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=48542100)). That maps to an **RTX 3090, 4090, or the RTX 5090 entry tier** on the GPU side.

The tiers, honestly:

- **8 GB VRAM / 16 GB unified Mac memory** — the practical floor. You can run a 7–8B model for autocomplete and small edits. Real agentic work will frustrate you; cloud is still your main tool here.
- **16 GB VRAM** — Codestral-class completion and mid-size models. Genuinely useful for day-to-day editing.
- **24 GB VRAM** — the line where local stops being a compromise. Qwen3-Coder-Next, Devstral 2, DeepSeek V3.2 all fit.
- **Apple Silicon (M-series, 32–128 GB unified)** — the dark horse. A Mac Studio (**~$4,000–5,000**, per the [dev.to cost breakdown](https://dev.to/kunal_d6a8fea2309e1571ee7/local-llm-vs-claude-for-daily-coding-real-data-2026-1nke)) runs large models off unified memory; throughput is lower than a 5090 but the memory ceiling is far higher.

The math that makes people pull the trigger: a heavy Claude/Cursor habit runs **$100–200/month**. A 24 GB GPU pays for itself against that in well under a year and then keeps producing at marginal-cost-zero. If you're sizing a dedicated local-AI box, I went through the desktop-superchip options in [NVIDIA RTX Spark and Windows local-AI](/en/notes/nvidia-rtx-spark-windows-ai-agents-2026).`,
        },
        {
            heading: "When a local model replaces cloud — and when it doesn't",
            content: `Here is the part the "I cancelled my subscription" posts skip past. **Local replaces ~80% of your sessions, not 100%** — and the honest framing is that the last slice is the expensive slice.

Where local wins cleanly: code completion, single-file refactors, writing tests, explaining unfamiliar code, boilerplate generation, regex and SQL, and anything you'd run dozens of times a day where rate limits and per-token cost actually hurt. For this bucket, a 24 GB local model is not a compromise — it's *better*, because it's free and instant.

Where local still loses: **multi-file agentic work, designing a new system boundary, debugging a subtle concurrency bug, navigating an unfamiliar framework end-to-end.** As the benchmark roundups put it, **a $500 GPU gets you 85–90% of Claude's quality on routine work — but that missing 10–15% is exactly where the hard problems live** ([dev.to real-data breakdown](https://dev.to/kunal_d6a8fea2309e1571ee7/local-llm-vs-claude-for-daily-coding-real-data-2026-1nke)). Frontier cloud models also still hold an edge in raw breadth of knowledge and long-horizon agentic reliability.

So the trap to avoid is the all-or-nothing frame. The developers who are happiest are not the purists who went fully local and now fight the model on hard tasks. They're the ones who **demoted cloud from "default tool" to "escalation path"** — local handles the volume, cloud handles the genuinely hard 20%, and the monthly bill drops by most of $100–200 without a productivity hit.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How I would ship this: the hybrid routing pattern',
            content: `I run local models every day — Ollama drives the on-device art-direction and a local model fork for one of my internal pipelines — so this isn't theory. The pattern I'd put into a client setup is **a router, not a switch.** You don't choose local *or* cloud once; you route each request based on how hard it is.

The cheapest version is a tiny middleware in front of an OpenAI-compatible gateway:

\`\`\`python
# Route by difficulty: local for the 80%, cloud for the hard 20%.
LOCAL = "http://localhost:11434/v1"          # Ollama, $0/token
CLOUD = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"        # escalation path

HARD_SIGNALS = ("multi-file", "architecture", "debug race", "design system")

def route(task: str, files_touched: int) -> str:
    hard = files_touched > 3 or any(s in task.lower() for s in HARD_SIGNALS)
    return CLOUD if hard else LOCAL
\`\`\`

Wrap that in a gateway (LiteLLM, OpenRouter, or Portkey) and you get one endpoint, automatic fallback, and a single place to log cost — I compared those gateways in [OpenRouter vs LiteLLM vs Portkey](/en/notes/openrouter-vs-litellm-vs-portkey-india-mvp-2026). The integration that won't be in any README: **make local the default and cloud the fallback, not the reverse.** Most "hybrid" setups quietly route everything to cloud and call the local model a backup — which means you're still paying full freight and still down when the provider is.

And that last point is the freshest reason to do this. Earlier today Anthropic posted "[elevated errors across many models](https://status.claude.com/incidents/xmhsglsz3h3w)." For teams whose entire workflow is one cloud API key, that's a blocked afternoon — the failure mode dev.to flagged this week as "[your AI provider is a single point of failure](https://dev.to/)." For anyone running local-as-default with cloud-as-escalation, the same outage is a shrug: the 80% kept working on localhost. Resilience, not just cost, is the real case for going local-first in 2026.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'FAQ: local LLMs for coding',
            content: `**What is the best local LLM for coding in 2026?** For a 24 GB GPU, **Qwen3-Coder-Next** is the best all-round pick — ~58.7% SWE-bench Verified, 256K context, runs on a single card. Devstral 2 edges it on agentic multi-file work if you have 32 GB; Codestral 25.12 is the 16 GB completion pick.

**Can a local LLM really replace Claude or GPT?** For about 80% of daily coding — completion, refactors, tests, explanation — yes. For the hard 10–15% (multi-file architecture, subtle concurrency, unfamiliar frameworks), cloud still wins. Use a hybrid setup, not a hard switch.

**How much VRAM do I need to run a local coding model?** 24 GB is the 2026 sweet spot (RTX 3090/4090/5090). 16 GB runs Codestral-class models well; 12 GB runs a distilled DeepSeek-Coder; 8 GB / 16 GB unified Mac is the floor for autocomplete only. Apple Silicon with 32 GB+ unified memory is a strong, often-overlooked option.

**Is it cheaper than a Claude subscription?** A heavy cloud habit is **$100–200/month**; a 24 GB GPU pays that back in under a year, then runs at zero marginal cost. The break-even depends on your usage, but for daily heavy users it's clearly favorable.

**What runtime should I use?** **Ollama** is the easiest on-ramp — two commands and you have a localhost OpenAI-compatible endpoint that Continue, Aider, and OpenCode can all target.`,
