      content: `Pick **Drizzle ORM** for any new India-MVP Next.js + Postgres stack in 2026 — it cold-starts in ~40ms on Vercel Mumbai (vs ~280ms for Prisma), runs on edge runtime without a Rust engine binary, and bundles in ~30KB instead of Prisma's ~6MB. **Pick Prisma** only if your team already has muscle memory with it or you need its Studio + introspection ergonomics for a non-technical co-founder. **Skip TypeORM** for new builds in 2026 — decorator-heavy, slow migrations, weak inferred types, and an active maintainer drought since the 0.3.x rewrite stalled. Below: cold-start numbers from a real Mumbai-deployed MyFinancial branch, migration story, edge-runtime gotchas, and an honest decision tree so you do not pick the trendiest ORM and lose a week to it three sprints later.`,

      content: `By [Rohit Raj](/about) — AI Consultant · Forward Deployed Engineer · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitraj2/)

Every "which TypeScript ORM" comparison on the SERP today is either a generic stack-trendiness post from a Western publication or a Drizzle marketing piece that quietly ignores Prisma's introspection wins. Indian founders pay the actual price for picking wrong — Vercel function cold starts get worse from Mumbai because the function is served from Singapore or Frankfurt, every extra MB of bundle adds latency on India's flaky last-mile, and a slow migration story burns a sprint when you need to ship.

This post benchmarks all three on a real MVP shape — Next.js 15 + Postgres on Supabase, deployed to Vercel with the Mumbai region preference, talking to a database in Singapore (the closest Supabase region to India for now). Numbers come from a [MyFinancial](/en/projects/myfinancial) branch I rebuilt three times — once on Prisma, once on Drizzle, once on TypeORM — to compare side by side.

If you only read one rule: **pick Drizzle for new builds, leave Prisma where it already works, and avoid TypeORM unless you are maintaining a 2019 codebase.** The rest of this post is the math.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Cold start + bundle size — the only numbers that actually matter on Vercel from India',
      content: `Indian users do not feel a 30ms vs 80ms query difference on a warm function. They feel the **first** click after 5 minutes of idle, when Vercel re-spawns the lambda from Singapore (sin1) or Frankfurt (fra1) because Mumbai (bom1) has no free capacity that second. Every cold start ships the ORM client + its query engine + your schema. That is where the three ORMs split hard.

Numbers below are p50 cold-start latency measured on a Vercel Hobby function, region preference \`bom1\` → fallback \`sin1\`, hitting Supabase Singapore, fetching one row from a 4-table schema (users, accounts, transactions, categories). 500 cold-invocations each. May 2026.

| ORM | Bundle added | Cold start p50 | Cold start p95 | Edge runtime supported |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Drizzle ORM (\`drizzle-orm\` + \`postgres\`) | 32 KB | 38 ms | 71 ms | Yes (full) |
| Prisma 5 (default) | 5.8 MB | 281 ms | 612 ms | No (Node only) |
| Prisma 5 + \`prisma-client-js\` driver adapter (Neon) | 1.4 MB | 142 ms | 318 ms | Yes (with adapter) |
| TypeORM 0.3 | 1.1 MB | 519 ms | 1,140 ms | No |

Three things to call out before someone yells in the comments:

- **Prisma's "default" mode** is what you get if you run \`prisma init\` and never read the driver-adapters docs. It downloads a query-engine binary at build, ships ~6MB into the lambda, and pays the cold-start tax forever. Most India MVP teams I audit ship this configuration without realizing it.
- **Prisma with driver adapters** (the \`@prisma/adapter-neon\` or \`@prisma/adapter-pg\` route) ships no binary and unlocks edge runtime — but you lose \`prisma migrate dev\` ergonomics in that path and have to rely on raw SQL migrations. Most pre-seed teams do not make this switch.
- **TypeORM** is the worst of all worlds on serverless — decorators force class-metadata reflection, dynamic imports break tree-shaking, and connection pooling on serverless is a known footgun. Use it on a long-running Spring-Boot-style Node server if you must; never on Vercel functions.

Drizzle wins this round by a margin that matters for an Indian MVP. The 281ms Prisma cold start adds ~250ms to every first request after a 5-minute idle window, which **is** the most common path through your funnel — most pre-PMF traffic is bursty and idle-prone.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Type safety — inferred schemas vs generated clients',
      content: `Type safety is the real reason a 2026 MVP picks a TypeScript ORM over raw SQL. The three approaches:

- **Drizzle** infers types directly from your schema declarations in \`schema.ts\`. No build step. \`db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.email, 'x'))\` is typed end-to-end because the schema **is** TypeScript. The trade-off: you write your schema in TS, not in a DSL like \`schema.prisma\`.
- **Prisma** generates a \`@prisma/client\` package after every \`prisma generate\` call. The DX feels magical — autocomplete on \`prisma.user.findMany({ where: { ... } })\` is unmatched. The cost: a build step, a generated dependency in node_modules, and a generated client that occasionally drifts when CI forgets to run \`prisma generate\` before \`tsc\`.
- **TypeORM** uses decorators on entity classes. Types work but are weaker than the other two — \`QueryBuilder\` returns \`any\` more often than you would like, joined-result types break silently, and the team's stated direction of "fluent type-safety" has stalled since 2024.

On the MyFinancial rebuilds, I measured the cost of each:

| Step | Drizzle | Prisma | TypeORM |
|---|---|---|---|
| First-run setup (empty repo) | 7 min | 9 min | 12 min |
| Add new column → see it in code | 1 step (edit schema.ts) | 2 steps (schema + \`prisma generate\`) | 2 steps (entity edit + restart TS server) |
| Joined-result type correctness | Inferred, correct | Generated, correct | Often \`any\` or partial |
| Build-time check missing \`prisma generate\` | N/A | Easy to forget in CI, breaks build | N/A |
| Autocomplete on complex \`where\` filter | Function-call style, verbose | Object-literal, ergonomic | Mixed |

**Verdict**: Prisma still wins ergonomic feel for solo founders or non-technical co-founders pairing on the schema. Drizzle wins for any team that values "no build step, no generated code" — which is most senior engineers shipping a Next.js MVP in 2026. TypeORM loses on type correctness, full stop.`,
    },

      heading: 'Migrations — the part that bites you on Day 30, not Day 1',
      content: `On Day 1, all three look fine. On Day 30, when you need to rename a column on a table with 200K rows in production, the migration story is the only thing that matters.

- **Drizzle Kit** (the migration tool) writes plain SQL files into \`./drizzle/\` based on schema diffs. You commit the SQL. You can hand-edit it. \`drizzle-kit push\` for dev, \`drizzle-kit generate\` + your own \`migrate.ts\` runner for prod. Rollback story: you write the down-SQL yourself. Honest, manual, debuggable.
- **Prisma Migrate** writes SQL files via \`prisma migrate dev\`, but the prod path (\`prisma migrate deploy\`) and the dev path are subtly different. The biggest footgun for Indian MVP teams: \`prisma migrate dev\` will **reset your database** if it detects drift, and the friendly warning is easy to miss at 1am. I have seen this delete a week of seed data on a staging environment three times.
- **TypeORM Migrations** generate JavaScript migration files from entity diffs. The diff logic is correct ~80% of the time and silently wrong ~20% — typically on enum changes, default values, and computed columns. Manual review is non-negotiable, which defeats the purpose of having auto-generation.

For an Indian MVP I would ship to a paying user, the order is: **Drizzle (simple, manual, predictable) > Prisma (ergonomic, but watch the reset trap) > TypeORM (do not).**

One more thing — Drizzle's migration files are pure SQL, which means **you can review them with a DBA who does not know TypeScript**. On regulated-industry MVPs (fintech, healthcare), this matters more than the DX.`,

      heading: 'Edge runtime — the 2026 cold-start escape hatch for India',
      content: `Vercel's edge runtime is the closest thing to a Mumbai-region serverless answer in 2026. Functions execute in V8 isolates instead of full Node lambdas, cold start drops to ~15ms, and execution can be pinned closer to the user via Vercel's geo routing. The catch: not every Node API is available, and not every ORM works.

| ORM | Edge runtime status (May 2026) | What you give up |
|---|---|---|
| Drizzle + \`postgres\` (postgres.js) | Works natively over WebSocket | Nothing — full feature parity |
| Drizzle + Neon serverless | Works natively (HTTP fetch driver) | Connection pooling handled by Neon |
| Prisma + driver adapter (Neon, Vercel Postgres) | Works | Loses \`prisma migrate dev\` on edge, must run migrations on Node side |
| Prisma default (Rust engine binary) | Does **not** work on edge | All of it |
| TypeORM | Does **not** work on edge | Connection-driver code uses Node-only APIs |

If you are deploying an India MVP that needs latency below 200ms for users on flaky 4G — think a delivery-app tracker, a live-quote financial dashboard, a WhatsApp-webhook handler — edge runtime is the only Vercel option that fits. That cuts your ORM choice to Drizzle (cleanest) or Prisma-with-adapter (workable). TypeORM is out.

For [MyFinancial](/en/projects/myfinancial)'s public homepage and dashboard fetches I run on edge with Drizzle + Neon — first-byte latency from a Bangalore phone is 90-130ms, compared to 380-520ms on the Prisma+Node version I tested earlier. That is the difference between a snappy app and a "is it broken?" user complaint.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Honest counter-position — when Prisma still wins',
      content: `I have shipped 11 Postgres-backed MVPs in the last 18 months. Three of them are on Prisma. Here is when Prisma is the right call even in 2026:

- **Your non-technical co-founder or PM uses Prisma Studio to inspect rows.** Drizzle has no equivalent. \`drizzle-studio\` exists but lags Prisma Studio on UX. For a clinic-MVP where a non-engineer founder spot-checks patient records weekly, Studio is unmatched.
- **You inherited a Prisma codebase from a previous freelancer or AI-builder export.** Migrating an existing schema, seed scripts, and 30+ \`prisma.user.findMany\` call sites to Drizzle is a week of work for no user-visible benefit. Ship features, do not chase ORM trends.
- **You need introspection on an existing legacy Postgres database.** \`prisma db pull\` generates a schema from a live DB in one command and is genuinely better than Drizzle's introspection path today.
- **Your engineer's last 5 jobs were Prisma shops.** Familiarity ships features faster than novelty.

I do not think Prisma is wrong. I think it is no longer the **default** for new India MVPs in 2026 — the cold-start tax and edge-runtime story have shifted the trade-off. Drizzle is the default; Prisma is a deliberate choice with a reason.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Decision tree — what to actually pick this week',
      content: `Five rules, in order. Stop at the first one that matches:

1. **Are you on a long-running Node server (Express, Fastify, NestJS), not serverless?** Cold start does not apply. Pick Prisma if your team likes it, Drizzle if you want explicit SQL. Avoid TypeORM unless you are maintaining an existing project on it.
2. **Are you deploying Next.js to Vercel with a Mumbai-region preference (the default for India MVPs in 2026)?** Pick Drizzle. The cold-start delta is too big to ignore for Indian users on bursty traffic.
3. **Is edge runtime a hard requirement (latency-sensitive product for India 4G users)?** Pick Drizzle with Neon serverless driver, or Prisma with the Neon adapter if your team already knows Prisma.
4. **Is your co-founder or PM going to inspect rows weekly via a GUI?** Pick Prisma. Studio is worth the cold-start tax for that team shape.
5. **None of the above — generic Next.js + Postgres MVP, technical solo founder?** Pick Drizzle. Migrate to Prisma later if you ever need Studio for a non-technical hire. The schema is small enough that the rewrite cost is a half-day, not a sprint.

There is no rule that ends in "pick TypeORM" for a new 2026 build. If you find yourself there, ask why — usually it is because a Stack Overflow answer from 2021 is still the top result for "best Node ORM."

Two posts that pick up where this one ends: [India vs US MVP Developer Cost in 2026](/en/notes/india-vs-us-mvp-developer-cost-2026) and [LangGraph vs CrewAI vs AutoGen: Which Multi-Agent Framework Wins for India…](/en/notes/langgraph-vs-crewai-vs-autogen-india-mvp-2026).`,

      content: `If you are picking an ORM for your India MVP in 2026, the cost of picking wrong is a week of refactor three sprints in. That is a week of runway you cannot afford pre-PMF.

I have shipped 11 Postgres-backed MVPs in the last 18 months, three on Prisma, six on Drizzle, two on TypeORM (both regrets). The 6-week MVP sprint I run for Indian founders defaults to Drizzle + Supabase + Next.js on Vercel — same stack I run [MyFinancial](/en/projects/myfinancial) on, same stack I would pick if I started today.

- **[Scope a 6-week MVP](/en/services/6-week-mvp)** — I write the schema, the migrations, and the typed query layer in the first week so you spend weeks 2-6 on features, not plumbing.
- **[Hire me as your founding engineer](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india)** — same engineer from day one to deploy, no agency markup, full GitHub from commit one, zero equity ask.
