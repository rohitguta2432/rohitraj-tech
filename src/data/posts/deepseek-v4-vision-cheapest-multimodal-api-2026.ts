        'DeepSeek turned on vision for V4 this week — image understanding inside chat.deepseek.com and the API, hitting the Hacker News front page on June 18, 2026. The hook for builders: it encodes an ~800×800 image into roughly 90 KV-cache entries versus ~870 for Claude and ~1,100 for Gemini, which is where the "10x cheaper multimodal" headline comes from. This is the builder read — what actually shipped, the OpenAI-SDK call you paste today, where DeepSeek vision wins (OCR, documents, charts, UI screenshots), where it still loses to GPT and Gemini, an honest cost-and-capability comparison table, and how I would wire it in production with a fallback so a single cheap model never becomes a single point of failure.',

When DeepSeek V4 shipped on April 24, 2026, it was a text and coding model — fast, absurdly cheap, and explicitly *not* multimodal. I checked at the time: the [public V4 spec sheets](https://www.morphllm.com/deepseek-v4) listed a 1M-token context window, DeepSeek Sparse Attention, and SWE-bench numbers, with zero vision benchmarks. So the interesting thing about this week is not "a new model dropped." It is that DeepSeek bolted vision onto the V4 family it already serves at commodity prices, and the result is the first genuinely *cheap* production multimodal API.

The announcement was understated — the [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=48581458) just pointed at chat.deepseek.com and let people discover that you can now paste an image — but it pulled 490 points and 200 comments in a day because the implication is large. If you run an image-heavy pipeline (invoice OCR, document extraction, chart parsing, screenshot QA), your multimodal bill has been set by GPT-4o-class and Claude-class pricing. DeepSeek vision resets that floor by an order of magnitude.

This is the builder's read, not a launch recap. Below: exactly what changed and the concrete numbers behind the "10x cheaper" claim, the copy-paste API call (it is OpenAI-compatible, so it is a base-URL swap), the three workflows where DeepSeek vision is the obvious pick, a comparison table against GPT, Claude, and Gemini that the cheerleader posts skip, an honest section on when *not* to use it, and how I would actually wire it into a product so betting on one cheap Chinese model does not become a single point of failure.`,
        },
        {
            heading: "What actually shipped in DeepSeek V4 Vision — and what is the number behind the hype?",
            content: `Vision is not a separate model. It is a capability now exposed through the two V4 API models you may already be calling: **deepseek-v4-pro** and **deepseek-v4-flash**. Both keep the 1M-token context window and the OpenAI-SDK-compatible endpoint at \`https://api.deepseek.com\`; the only new thing is that the \`content\` array of a message can now carry images alongside text ([DeepSeek API docs](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)). On the consumer side, the same capability turned on inside [chat.deepseek.com](https://chat.deepseek.com/) the same week.

The architecture detail that matters is how DeepSeek tokenizes an image. Per [MindStudio's teardown](https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/deepseek-v4-vision-cheaper-multimodal-ai-workflows), a roughly 800×800 image becomes about **90 KV-cache entries**, against **~870 for Claude 3.5/4-class** and **~1,100 for Gemini**. DeepSeek frames the extreme version of this as an OCR-compression result: **100 vision tokens can reconstruct the original text of a page at about 97% accuracy**, an effective compression ratio in the thousands from raw pixels to cache entries. Fewer tokens per image is not a vanity metric — vision cost is dominated by how many tokens an image becomes, so a ~10x reduction in image tokens is a ~10x reduction in the image portion of your bill.

Stacked on V4's already-low text pricing — **V4-Flash at $0.14 / $0.28 per million input/output tokens and V4-Pro at $0.435 / $0.87** ([morphllm spec sheet](https://www.morphllm.com/deepseek-v4)) — the compound effect is dramatic. MindStudio pegs V4-Flash at roughly **1/170th the per-image cost of Claude Opus**, and V4-Pro at about **14x cheaper than GPT-4o** for the same image-understanding task. On capability, DeepSeek's own numbers are selective but real: **67% on a topological maze-navigation benchmark versus 50% for GPT-5.4 and 49% for Gemini Flash 3**, alongside strong OCRBench results. It does not claim to beat the frontier across the board — and that honesty matters for how you use it.

Two more details shape how you pick a variant. The backbones differ by an order of magnitude: **V4-Flash is a 284B-total / 13B-active MoE, while V4-Pro is 1.6T-total / 49B-active** ([morphllm](https://www.morphllm.com/deepseek-v4)). For straightforward extraction — invoices, receipts, clean PDFs — Flash is almost always enough, and at its price you would have to be doing something exotic to justify Pro. Reach for Pro only when the task needs genuine multi-step visual reasoning (a cluttered dashboard, a diagram you have to *interpret* rather than transcribe). And because vision is native to the V4 attention stack rather than a separate encoder bolted on at inference, the 1M-token context applies to mixed image-and-text prompts — you can put a multi-page document and your instructions in one call instead of chunking, which is its own quiet cost win on orchestration.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How do you call the DeepSeek vision API? (it is a base-URL swap)',
            content: `Because DeepSeek speaks the OpenAI wire format, you do not learn a new SDK. If you already use the \`openai\` package, you point it at DeepSeek's base URL and key, then send an image the same way you would to GPT-4o — as a \`image_url\` content part, either a public URL or a base64 data URI:

\`\`\`python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_DEEPSEEK_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.deepseek.com",   # the only line that differs from OpenAI
)

with open("invoice.png", "rb") as f:
    b64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-v4-flash",             # or deepseek-v4-pro for harder reasoning
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text",
             "text": "Extract every line item as JSON: description, qty, unit_price, total."},
            {"type": "image_url",
             "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/png;base64,{b64}"}},
        ],
    }],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
\`\`\`

Two practical notes the docs bury. First, **prefer hosted URLs over base64 when you can** — base64 inflates the request body by ~33% and you pay for the round trip, while a URL lets DeepSeek fetch and tokenize server-side. Second, **ask for structured output explicitly.** Vision models drift into prose; pinning a JSON shape in the prompt (or using the response-format controls) is what turns a demo into a pipeline. If you are migrating an existing multimodal feature, this is genuinely a one-file change — swap \`base_url\` and the model id, keep the rest. That low switching cost is half of why this launch matters: there is almost no integration tax to A/B test it against your current provider. For a deeper provider-cost comparison across text workloads too, I keep a running breakdown in [OpenAI vs Claude vs Gemini API cost for an India MVP](/notes/openai-vs-claude-vs-gemini-api-cost-india-mvp-2026).`,

            heading: 'Where does DeepSeek vision actually shine?',
            content: `Cheap-per-image only matters if you send a lot of images, so DeepSeek vision is at its best in volume-OCR and document-extraction work where the incumbents' pricing makes the unit economics painful.

**1. Invoice, receipt, and form extraction at scale.** This is the killer app. If you process tens of thousands of documents a month, the difference between ~90 and ~870 image tokens is the difference between a viable margin and a line item your CFO circles in red. DeepSeek's OCR-compression lineage (it grew out of the DeepSeek-VL and DeepSeek-OCR work, [documented by Roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/deepseek-vision-models/)) means text-in-image is its home turf — exactly the workload where a fintech or back-office product lives.

**2. Chart, table, and dashboard parsing.** Turning a screenshot of a chart or a PDF table into structured numbers is a task where DeepSeek's document-understanding heritage shows. For an analytics or finance product that ingests user-uploaded statements, this is high-volume and tolerant of a quick human spot-check — a perfect fit for a cheap model.

**3. UI screenshot understanding for agents.** Agent frameworks that "look" at a screen burn vision tokens on every step. At ~90 tokens per frame, DeepSeek makes screen-reading loops affordable that would be cost-prohibitive on Claude or Gemini. This is where the cheap-per-image property compounds across a long agent trajectory.

Here is the personal angle. I run [MyFinancial](/projects), where users upload bank and brokerage statements and we extract holdings and transactions. On a Claude- or GPT-class vision model, the per-document cost forces you to cache aggressively and rate-limit free users hard. With a model at a fraction of the per-image price, I would re-architect that flow tomorrow: extract eagerly on upload, skip the caching gymnastics, and pass *every* page rather than heuristically picking "the important ones." The cost ceiling that shaped the product design largely disappears. The failure mode I would watch is silent extraction errors on low-quality phone photos — cheap inference tempts you to skip validation, and a wrong number in a finance app is worse than a slow one.`,

            heading: 'How does DeepSeek V4 Vision compare to GPT, Claude, and Gemini?',
            content: `No single model wins every axis. Here is the honest spread, using the most commonly cited figures (image token counts and prices fluctuate by resolution and provider promo, so treat these as orders of magnitude, not quotes):

| Feature | DeepSeek V4 Vision | GPT-4o / GPT-5.x Vision | Claude (Sonnet/Opus) Vision | Gemini Flash 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KV-cache per ~800×800 image | **~90 tokens** | ~765 tokens | ~870 tokens | ~1,100 tokens |
| Relative per-image cost | **~1x (baseline)** | ~14–79x | ~120–170x | ~14x |
| Text input price (per 1M) | **$0.14 (Flash) / $0.435 (Pro)** | higher | highest | low–mid |
| Context window | 1M tokens | 128K–400K | 200K | 1M |
| API style | OpenAI-compatible | native OpenAI | Anthropic SDK | Google SDK |
| Frontier visual reasoning | good, not best | **best-in-class** | excellent | very good |
| Confirmed open weights (vision) | not at launch | no | no | no |
| Data residency outside China | no | yes | yes | yes |

Read it this way: DeepSeek wins decisively on **cost and image-token efficiency** and ties on context window. GPT and Claude win on **top-end visual reasoning** and ecosystem trust. Gemini Flash 3 is the closest on price among the Western trio but still encodes images far more expensively. If your workload is "lots of documents, good-enough accuracy, tight budget," DeepSeek is the obvious pick. If it is "few images, must be exactly right, regulated data," stay on a frontier provider. For the text-side of that same buy decision, my [DeepSeek vs Claude vs GPT cost breakdown for India MVPs](/notes/deepseek-vs-claude-vs-gpt-india-mvp-cost-2026) goes deeper on the trade-offs.`,

            heading: 'When should you skip DeepSeek vision (or keep a fallback)?',
            content: `Cheap is not the same as correct, and there are concrete reasons to either avoid DeepSeek vision or never run it without a backstop.

**Data residency and compliance.** DeepSeek's API is operated from China. For healthcare, finance, or EU-resident data with GDPR or sectoral residency requirements, sending user images to that endpoint may be a non-starter regardless of price. This is a legal question, not a technical one — answer it before you wire anything.

**Frontier accuracy.** DeepSeek itself does not claim to beat GPT-5.4 across the board; it wins on selected benchmarks like maze navigation and loses elsewhere. For medical imaging, safety-critical inspection, or anything where a wrong read has real consequences, the cheapest model is the wrong optimization.

**Open-weights expectations.** DeepSeek's *text* models have a strong open-weights track record, which led people to assume the vision variant is downloadable. As of launch that is **not clearly confirmed** — the [Roboflow roundup](https://blog.roboflow.com/deepseek-vision-models/) covers the older open DeepSeek-VL2 weights, but the V4 vision capability is, for now, an API product. If your plan depended on self-hosting it, verify before you commit.

**Maturity.** This shipped *this week*. Rate limits, uptime, and behavior under load are unproven at scale. Treat it the way you would any week-old endpoint: instrument it, and have a fallback ready.`,

        {
            heading: 'How I would ship DeepSeek vision in production',
            content: `The single most important decision is to not make a brand-new, week-old, single-region model a hard dependency. I would put it behind a thin provider interface so it is one model among several, not *the* model.

\`\`\`python
async def extract_from_image(img_url: str, schema: str) -> dict:
    # 1. Try the cheap model first.
    try:
        out = await call_vision("deepseek-v4-flash", img_url, schema, timeout=20)
        if validate(out, schema):          # 2. Validate BEFORE trusting it.
            return out
    except (TimeoutError, ApiError):
        pass
    # 3. Fall back to a frontier model only when the cheap path fails or fails validation.
    return await call_vision("gpt-5.x-vision", img_url, schema, timeout=30)
\`\`\`

The wiring details that decide whether this is robust:

- **Validate every extraction.** A schema check (and for finance, a totals-reconcile check) catches the silent-error failure mode that cheap inference tempts you to ignore. Route validation failures to the fallback, not to the user.
- **Send URLs, not base64, from your storage tier.** Upload to S3/R2 first, pass the signed URL. Smaller request bodies, server-side tokenization, and you get an audit trail of exactly what the model saw.
- **Set per-tenant budgets and rate limits.** Cheap inference makes it tempting to remove guardrails; do the opposite — cheap-per-call plus a bug equals a large bill, fast.
- **Log the model id and token counts per request.** When you A/B DeepSeek against your incumbent, you want the cost and accuracy delta in your own data, not a vendor's blog.
- **Pin a known-good model id.** "deepseek-v4-flash" today; don't auto-track "latest" in production.

That fallback pattern is the whole game: you capture ~90% of the cost savings on the easy majority of images and pay frontier prices only on the hard minority. This is exactly the kind of provider-abstraction-plus-validation plumbing I build for clients in a [6-week MVP](/services/6-week-mvp) — and the kind of "looks simple, has five sharp edges" integration where a [founding engineer](/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) earns their keep, because the README shows you the happy path and never the residency, validation, and fallback work that makes it safe to ship.`,

            content: `DeepSeek V4 Vision does not dethrone GPT or Claude on raw visual intelligence, and it should not change your plans if you process a handful of images where every read must be perfect. What it does is move the price floor for *volume* multimodal work down by roughly an order of magnitude, with a zero-friction OpenAI-compatible API that you can A/B against your current provider in an afternoon. For OCR, document extraction, chart parsing, and agent screen-reading at scale, that is a genuinely new option — the first time "cheap" and "production multimodal" have been true in the same sentence. Adopt it where the workload is high-volume and error-tolerant, gate it behind validation and a frontier fallback, and answer the data-residency question first. Do that, and the savings are real without the risk being.

Building something image-heavy and trying to figure out whether to bet on the cheap model?
