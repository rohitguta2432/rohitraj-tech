PostgreSQL is the better database for most startups because it handles relational data, JSON documents, full-text search, and vector embeddings in a single system with full ACID transactions. MongoDB is the better choice when your data is genuinely document-shaped, your schema changes constantly during rapid prototyping, or you need horizontal sharding across regions from day one.

Every few years, someone declares SQL dead. Then someone declares NoSQL dead. Neither has died. Both are thriving in 2026.

I've used PostgreSQL for StellarMIND (AI analytics platform) and myFinancial (personal finance tracker). I've used MongoDB on client projects where document storage made sense. Here's my honest take on when each one wins.

**The short answer for impatient readers:** If you're not sure, pick PostgreSQL. It does everything MongoDB does (JSON columns, full-text search, vector embeddings) plus everything MongoDB can't (joins, transactions, constraints). You can always add MongoDB later for specific use cases.`
    },
    {
      heading: 'How Do PostgreSQL and MongoDB Compare in 2026?',
      content: `| Feature | PostgreSQL 17 | MongoDB 8 |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Schema | Structured + JSONB flex | Schema-less by default |
| Joins | Native, fast | $lookup (slow, limited) |
| Transactions | Full ACID | Multi-document ACID (since 4.0) |
| Full-text search | Built-in (tsvector) | Built-in (Atlas Search) |
| Vector search | pgvector extension | Atlas Vector Search |
| Scaling | Vertical + read replicas | Horizontal sharding native |
| JSON support | JSONB (indexed, queryable) | Native (it's the default) |
| Geospatial | PostGIS (best in class) | Built-in (good) |
| Free hosted tier | Supabase, Neon, Railway | MongoDB Atlas (512MB) |

**PostgreSQL wins on:**
- Data integrity and constraints — foreign keys, check constraints, unique constraints
- Complex queries — JOINs, CTEs, window functions, subqueries
- Ecosystem — pgvector for AI, PostGIS for geo, pg_cron for scheduling
- Cost — Supabase gives you 500MB free with auth, storage, and real-time built in

**MongoDB wins on:**
- Horizontal scaling — sharding is native and well-tested
- Flexible schemas — great when your data structure changes frequently
- Document-oriented workloads — nested objects, arrays, varying fields
- Developer experience for simple CRUD — no schema migrations, just store JSON`

      heading: 'When Should You Choose PostgreSQL vs MongoDB?',
      content: `**Choose PostgreSQL if:**
- Your data has relationships (users → orders → products)
- You need ACID transactions (payments, inventory, healthcare)
- You want one database for everything (relational + JSON + vectors + full-text search)
- You're using Supabase (PostgreSQL under the hood)
- You're building a SaaS product with a well-defined data model

**Choose MongoDB if:**
- Your data is genuinely document-shaped (CMS content, product catalogs with varying attributes)
- You need horizontal scaling across regions from day one
- Your schema changes constantly (rapid prototyping, A/B testing different data models)
- You're building IoT or event logging systems with high write throughput
- Your team has strong MongoDB experience

**Don't choose MongoDB because:**
- "It's faster" — It's not, for most workloads. PostgreSQL with proper indexing matches or beats MongoDB for reads.
- "We don't know our schema yet" — PostgreSQL's JSONB columns give you schema flexibility without losing relational power.
- "SQL is old" — So is HTTP. Age isn't a disadvantage for infrastructure.

For StellarMIND, PostgreSQL was the clear choice. The AI pipeline needs vector search (pgvector), the data has relational structure (users → databases → queries → results), and Supabase gave me auth + real-time for free.

**Common Mistakes When Choosing a Database:**

The number one mistake I see is choosing MongoDB because "we do not know our schema yet." This is backwards logic. When you do not know your schema, you need constraints even more — they force you to think about your data model early, which saves you from data integrity nightmares later. PostgreSQL's JSONB columns give you schema flexibility for the parts you are unsure about while enforcing structure on the parts you know. The second mistake is not adding indexes. I have seen MongoDB deployments where every query does a collection scan because nobody configured indexes. MongoDB is not magically fast — it needs indexes just like PostgreSQL. A properly indexed PostgreSQL query will outperform an unindexed MongoDB query every single time.`
    },
    {
      heading: 'The JSONB Superpower Most People Miss',
      content: `PostgreSQL's JSONB type is the reason the SQL vs NoSQL debate is mostly settled. You get the best of both worlds:

\`\`\`sql
-- Store flexible JSON data
CREATE TABLE products (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL,
price DECIMAL NOT NULL,
attributes JSONB  -- flexible schema per product
);

-- Query JSON fields with indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_products_brand ON products ((attributes->>'brand'));

SELECT * FROM products
WHERE attributes->>'brand' = 'Apple'
AND (attributes->>'weight')::numeric < 500;
\`\`\`

You get relational integrity for the structured parts (name, price) and document flexibility for the unstructured parts (attributes). Try doing a JOIN with price calculations in MongoDB — it's painful.

In myFinancial, I use JSONB for transaction metadata. Each transaction has a fixed schema (amount, date, category) plus flexible metadata (receipt URL, location, tags) stored as JSONB. One table, best of both worlds.

**What I Would Do Differently:**

On one client project, I used MongoDB for a multi-tenant SaaS product because the client insisted their data was "unstructured." Six months later, we were writing complex aggregation pipelines to join user data with billing records and generating reports that required multi-document transactions. We effectively reimplemented half of what PostgreSQL gives you for free, but with worse performance and more code. If I could redo that project, I would use PostgreSQL with JSONB for the genuinely flexible parts and relational tables for everything else. The lesson: start with PostgreSQL and add MongoDB only when you hit a specific scaling bottleneck that demands horizontal sharding.`

      heading: 'My Stack Recommendation',
      content: `For 90% of startups I work with, the answer is **PostgreSQL via Supabase**. Here's what you get out of the box:

- 500MB PostgreSQL database (free tier)
- Auth with email, OAuth, magic links
- Row-Level Security for multi-tenant apps
- Real-time subscriptions via WebSockets
- Storage for files and images
- Edge Functions for serverless compute
- pgvector for AI/embedding workloads

That's your entire backend for $0/month until you have real users. When you grow, Supabase Pro is $25/month with 8GB database and 100K monthly active users.

MongoDB Atlas free tier gives you 512MB — just the database. Auth, storage, real-time? You're stitching together separate services.

Pick PostgreSQL. Learn SQL. Ship your product. If you genuinely hit a scale problem that needs MongoDB's sharding (you probably won't — Instagram runs on PostgreSQL), migrate then.

The pattern I run for founders in this situation is either a [startup MVP build](/en/services/startup-mvp-development) or a [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp) — pick based on whether you need shipped code or shipped *and* maintained code.

If this thread is useful, [Spring Boot vs Node.js for Your Startup Backend (2026)](/en/notes/spring-boot-vs-nodejs-startup-backend-2026) and [Bolt.new vs Hire Developer 2026](/en/notes/bolt-new-vs-hire-developer-2026) are the next two posts to read.`

    {
      heading: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
      content: `**Q: Is MongoDB faster than PostgreSQL for read-heavy workloads?**

Not necessarily. For simple key-value lookups and document retrieval by ID, MongoDB and PostgreSQL perform similarly when properly indexed. PostgreSQL with JSONB and GIN indexes handles document-style queries efficiently. Where MongoDB can edge ahead is when your data is deeply nested and you query by nested fields frequently — MongoDB's native document model avoids the need for joins. But for any workload involving aggregations, sorting across fields, or combining data from multiple collections, PostgreSQL is faster because joins are native operations, not emulated with lookup stages.

**Q: Can I use PostgreSQL for real-time applications?**

Yes. Supabase provides real-time subscriptions built on PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY mechanism. When a row changes, connected clients receive the update via WebSockets within milliseconds. For most real-time use cases — live dashboards, collaborative editing, notification feeds — this is sufficient. MongoDB also offers Change Streams for real-time updates. Both databases handle real-time well, but Supabase makes it significantly easier to set up with PostgreSQL because real-time comes out of the box with row-level security.

**Q: How does pgvector compare to MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for AI applications?**

Both are production-ready for storing and querying vector embeddings. pgvector integrates directly into PostgreSQL, so you can combine vector similarity search with relational queries in a single SQL statement — for example, finding similar documents that also belong to a specific user and were created in the last 30 days. MongoDB Atlas Vector Search requires a separate index and works through the aggregation pipeline. For AI applications where embeddings are part of a larger data model with relational constraints, pgvector is more ergonomic.

**Q: Should I use an ORM or write raw SQL with PostgreSQL?**

For startups, use an ORM for basic CRUD and drop to raw SQL for complex queries. Prisma and Drizzle are excellent TypeScript ORMs that generate type-safe queries. Spring Data JPA works well for Java applications. The key is not becoming dependent on the ORM for everything — learn SQL, because when you need a complex report with window functions, CTEs, and lateral joins, no ORM can express that cleanly. Write your migrations in raw SQL and use the ORM for application-level data access.

**Q: When should I consider using both PostgreSQL and MongoDB together?**

Use both when you have genuinely different data patterns in the same application. A common example is an e-commerce platform: PostgreSQL for users, orders, payments, and inventory where relational integrity matters, and MongoDB for the product catalog where each product category has different attributes. Another valid case is event logging — high-throughput write workloads with schema-less events fit MongoDB well alongside a PostgreSQL primary database. But only add the second database when the pain of not having it outweighs the operational cost of maintaining two systems.`
