Your MVP should cost under $10,000 because the entire purpose of an MVP is to test your riskiest business assumption with minimal investment. A realistic budget is $5,000-$8,500 for a 4-6 week build using a free-tier stack (Supabase, Vercel, Stripe). Anything above $10K means you are overbuilding before validation — spending money on features that users may never want. Ship fast, learn, then invest more based on real data.

I've had founders come to me after spending $40K-60K on an MVP that doesn't work. The pattern is always the same: an agency sold them a "comprehensive solution" with admin panels, analytics dashboards, mobile apps, CRM integrations, and multi-language support — for a product that hadn't been validated with a single customer.

An MVP that costs $50K isn't an MVP. It's a premature product built on assumptions.

The whole point of an MVP is to test your riskiest assumption with the least amount of effort. If you're spending $50K before talking to 20 potential customers, you're gambling, not building a business.

Here's my rule: **if your MVP costs more than $10K, you're building too much.** Let me show you how I keep projects under this threshold.`

      heading: 'How Do You Decide What Features to Include in Your MVP?',
      content: `Every feature in your MVP should pass this test:

**"Will a customer pay for my product WITHOUT this feature?"**

If yes, cut it from v1. Build it in v2 when you have revenue and user feedback.

Here's how I apply this with real examples:

| Feature | Include in MVP? | Why |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| User auth (email + password) | Yes | Can't use the product without it |
| Social login (Google, Apple) | No | Nice-to-have, email works fine |
| Core problem-solving feature | Yes | This IS the product |
| Admin dashboard | Yes (basic) | You need to manage the product |
| Analytics dashboard | No | Use Google Analytics or Mixpanel free tier |
| Mobile app | No (usually) | A responsive web app works on phones |
| Email notifications | Yes (basic) | Critical for engagement |
| Push notifications | No | Add later, email is fine for v1 |
| Payment integration | Yes | You need to charge from day one |
| Multi-currency support | No | Pick one currency, add more later |
| Team/collaboration features | No | Start with single-user, add teams later |
| API for third-party integrations | No | Nobody is integrating with your MVP |

For myFinancial, the MVP was: auth, expense tracking, budget categories, and a monthly summary. No investment tracking, no multi-currency, no AI insights. Those came later after real users told me what they actually wanted.

**The "one week rule" for scope decisions:** If a feature takes more than one week to build, it probably does not belong in your MVP. One-week features are the building blocks of a lean product. Authentication takes 3-5 days. A basic payment flow takes 3-5 days. Your core feature should take 1-2 weeks. If any single feature is estimated at 3+ weeks, you are either overcomplicating the implementation or the feature itself is too ambitious for v1. Break it down into a simpler version that achieves 80% of the value in 20% of the time.`

      heading: 'What Free-Tier Tech Stack Can Run Your MVP at $0 Per Month?',
      content: `Here's the stack I use for sub-$10K MVPs. Monthly cost: $0 until you have real traction.

| Service | Free Tier | When You Start Paying |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Supabase (database + auth) | 500MB DB, 50K monthly active users | >500MB or need backups |
| Vercel or AWS Amplify (hosting) | 100GB bandwidth, serverless functions | >100GB bandwidth |
| Resend (email) | 3,000 emails/month | >3,000 emails |
| Stripe (payments) | No monthly fee | 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction |
| GitHub (code hosting) | Unlimited private repos | Never, for small teams |
| Upstash (Redis, if needed) | 10K commands/day | >10K commands |
| Cloudflare (CDN + DNS) | Unlimited bandwidth | Never, for most use cases |

**Total monthly cost: $0** for a product serving up to 1,000 users.

Compare this to what agencies propose: AWS ECS or Kubernetes ($100+/month), managed databases ($50+/month), dedicated CI/CD pipelines ($30+/month), monitoring tools ($20+/month). For an MVP with 0 users.

You don't need Kubernetes. You don't need a managed Redis cluster. You don't need a $200/month monitoring stack. You need Supabase, Vercel, and Stripe. Ship the product and upgrade infrastructure when your revenue justifies it.`

      heading: 'Real Examples: What $5K-$10K Gets You',
      content: `Here are real projects I've built or scoped in this budget range:

**MicroItinerary (travel planning tool) — ~$6K**
- Next.js web app with AI-powered itinerary generation
- Supabase for auth and data storage
- AWS Bedrock for AI features
- Deployed on AWS Amplify
- Built in 4 weeks

**ClinIQ AI (clinic management) — ~$9K for MVP**
- Spring Boot backend with WhatsApp API integration
- Appointment scheduling and patient management
- AI-powered appointment reminders
- Admin dashboard
- Built in 6 weeks

**A client's e-commerce MVP — ~$7K**
- Product catalog with search
- Shopping cart and checkout (Razorpay)
- Order management for admin
- Email notifications for orders
- Responsive web app (no native mobile app)
- Built in 5 weeks

None of these had: microservices, Kubernetes, custom analytics, mobile apps, multi-language support, or AI chatbots. They solved one core problem well, charged money from day one, and iterated based on user feedback.

**What happens after the MVP launches:** The first version is never the final product. After launch, your priorities shift from building to learning. Track three metrics: user signups (are people finding you?), activation rate (do they complete the core action?), and retention (do they come back?). If signups are low, your marketing or positioning is the problem — not the product. If activation is low, your onboarding or UX needs work. If retention is low, the core value proposition is not strong enough. Each insight costs $0 to discover but saves thousands in wasted development on the wrong features.`

      heading: 'How to Work With Me Under $10K',
      content: `Here's my process for budget MVPs:

**Step 1: Free scoping call (30 minutes)**
We define the core problem, the must-have features, and the nice-to-haves. I'll tell you honestly if your MVP can be built under $10K or if we need to cut scope.

**Step 2: Architecture document (free)**
I write up the tech stack, database schema, and feature list. You approve it before we start. No surprises.

**Step 3: Build in 4-6 week sprints**
Weekly demos every Friday. You see working software, not progress reports.

**Step 4: Launch and handoff**
I deploy to production, hand over all code and credentials, and provide 30 days of free bug fixes.

**Payment: 30-30-40 milestones**
- 30% to start
- 30% at midpoint demo
- 40% at delivery

You never pay for work you haven't seen. If the midpoint demo doesn't meet expectations, we stop and you've only spent 30%.

The founders who succeed aren't the ones with the biggest budgets. They're the ones who ship fast, talk to users, and iterate. A $7K MVP that launches in 5 weeks beats a $50K product that launches in 6 months — every single time.

On most of my client engagements this comes up as either a [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp) or a [startup MVP build](/en/services/startup-mvp-development) — either path leads to a working production build inside a quarter.

      heading: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
      content: `**Q: Can you really build a functional MVP for under $10,000?**

Yes. I have shipped multiple MVPs in the $5,000-$9,000 range including MicroItinerary (travel planning, ~$6K), a client e-commerce platform (~$7K), and ClinIQ AI (~$9K). The key is using free-tier infrastructure (Supabase, Vercel, Stripe), choosing cross-platform frameworks like Next.js or React Native, and limiting scope to 1-3 core features plus authentication and payments. The sub-$10K constraint actually forces better product decisions because you cannot waste budget on features nobody has asked for yet.

**Q: What is the difference between an MVP and a prototype?**

A prototype demonstrates the concept — it might be clickable mockups in Figma or a partially working demo. An MVP is a real, deployed product that users can sign up for, use, and pay for. Prototypes validate whether people understand your idea. MVPs validate whether people will pay for your solution. If you are still testing whether the idea makes sense, build a prototype for $500-$2,000. If you know the problem exists and want to test willingness to pay, build an MVP for $5,000-$10,000.

**Q: How do I find the right developer to build my MVP under $10K?**

Look for freelance developers with a portfolio of shipped products, not just design mockups. Ask for live URLs you can test yourself. Verify they have experience with free-tier stacks like Supabase and Vercel — developers accustomed to enterprise tooling may over-engineer your MVP. Request a milestone-based payment structure (30-30-40 is standard) and weekly demos. Most importantly, choose someone who pushes back on scope — a developer who says "you do not need that for v1" is more valuable than one who agrees to build everything you ask for.

**Q: What happens if my MVP needs more than $10K worth of features?**

Cut scope, not quality. Go through every feature and ask: "Will a customer pay for the product without this?" If yes, move it to v2. Common features that can wait include social login (email works fine), analytics dashboards (use Google Analytics), push notifications (email is sufficient for v1), mobile apps (responsive web works on phones), and team collaboration features (start with single-user). If after cutting everything non-essential the cost still exceeds $10K, your "MVP" might actually be a full product in disguise — revisit what you are really trying to validate.

**Q: Should I use no-code tools instead of hiring a developer for my MVP?**

No-code tools like Bubble work for validating demand with a simple landing page or waitlist. But for a real MVP that accepts payments, handles user authentication, and implements custom business logic, you will hit no-code limitations within weeks. The bigger risk is that no-code platforms create vendor lock-in — when you need to scale or add custom features, you face an expensive complete rewrite. My recommendation: use no-code for pre-MVP validation, then hire a developer to build the real product with code you own.`
