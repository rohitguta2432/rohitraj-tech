It's smaller than the **pre-existing community \`safari-mcp\` npm ecosystem** (80+ tools, AppleScript-driven, works on production Safari) that predates Apple's announcement. Use Apple's official one for WebKit-specific rendering bugs today; reach for the community package if you need it outside Technology Preview or want broader tool coverage now.`,

Describing a rendering bug to a coding agent is a lossy process. You type "the button looks off-center in Safari," the agent nods along, and it's still guessing at pixels it has never actually seen. **Apple just closed that gap.** Safari Technology Preview 247, released July 1, 2026, ships an official **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** built into the browser — so the agent can connect to a running Safari window, take its own screenshot, read the actual DOM, and check the console itself instead of trusting your description.

That one change removes a genuinely annoying loop. Before this, wiring an AI agent to "see" a rendered page meant standing up Playwright or Puppeteer to drive a second, separate Chromium instance — one that isn't logged into anything, doesn't share your cookies, and definitely isn't running WebKit's actual rendering engine. If your bug was Safari-specific (and CSS bugs disproportionately are), that second browser couldn't even reproduce it.

Why this matters right now: this is the **first time a browser vendor has shipped an official MCP server for its own browser**. Chrome has its DevTools MCP (a Google side project), and a community has already built third-party Safari automation tools — but this is Apple, in the browser itself, on day one of a Technology Preview build. Below is what actually shipped, how to install it, where it's genuinely useful, where it falls short, and — because there's real confusion here — how it's different from the older community \`safari-mcp\` tools that predate it by over a week.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'What\'s Actually New in Safari\'s MCP Server?',
            content: `The [official WebKit announcement](https://webkit.org/blog/18136/introducing-the-safari-mcp-server-for-web-developers/) describes it plainly: "a Model Context Protocol server for web developers that makes your web development and debugging workflow faster and more powerful." It ships inside **Safari Technology Preview build 247**, not the regular Safari that ships with macOS — so you need the Technology Preview app installed to use it at all.

Apple's own count is **16 built-in tools**, covering:

- Screenshot capture of the active tab
- DOM inspection and element interaction (click, type, scroll)
- Live JavaScript evaluation in the page context
- Console message retrieval
- Network request inspection
- Page content / text extraction
- Tab management
- Accessibility failure checks
- Viewport resizing / CSS media emulation

Under the hood it runs on **\`safaridriver\`**, the same WebDriver binary Apple has shipped for years for Selenium-style test automation — Apple just wrapped it in an MCP-compatible interface. Per Apple's own privacy note, the server runs **entirely on your local machine**, makes no network requests of its own, and cannot read browsing history or AutoFill data; whatever it captures goes straight to the AI client you connected it to, not to Apple.

Here's the part that actually needs explaining, because search results for "safari mcp server" right now surface two completely different things. There's Apple's brand-new **official** server described above — and there's a **separate, older community project** also called \`safari-mcp\` (maintained by developers like achiya-automation, with forks at [Epistates/MCPSafari](https://github.com/Epistates/MCPSafari) and [axivo/mcp-safari](https://github.com/axivo/mcp-safari)) that has existed since at least **June 23, 2026** — over a week before Apple's announcement. That community tool drives **regular, production Safari** (the one logged into your Gmail and GitHub) using AppleScript and a Swift helper process, and exposes **80+ tools**, roughly five times Apple's official count. They are not the same thing, they're not interchangeable, and picking the wrong one for your situation costs you a debugging session.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How Do You Actually Install and Use It?',
            content: `For **Apple's official server**, you need Safari Technology Preview installed first (a free download from Apple's developer site, separate from your default Safari). Then:

1. Open Safari Technology Preview → **Settings → Advanced** → enable "Show features for web developers"
2. **Settings → Developer** → enable "Allow Remote Automation"
3. Register it with your AI client from the terminal:

\`\`\`bash
# Claude Code — points directly at the STP safaridriver binary
claude mcp add safari-mcp-stp -- \\
  "/Applications/Safari Technology Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/safaridriver" --mcp
\`\`\`

Once registered, a prompt like *"open localhost:3000, take a screenshot, and tell me what's wrong with the header"* actually works — the agent calls the \`screenshot\` tool, reads the returned image, calls \`dom_inspect\` or \`console_read\` if it needs more context, and reasons over real data instead of your paraphrase of the bug.

For the **community \`safari-mcp\` package**, the install is a plain npm invocation rather than a Technology Preview dependency:

\`\`\`bash
# Community package — drives your normal, already-open Safari
npx safari-mcp
\`\`\`

It also needs two one-time toggles (Safari → **Settings → Advanced** → "Show features for web developers," then Safari → **Develop** → "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events") — but it runs against the Safari you already use daily, sessions and cookies intact, no separate Technology Preview install required.

Both run as local **stdio subprocesses** of your AI client — no hosted endpoint, no port to expose, no auth token to leak. That's a meaningfully smaller attack surface than an MCP server that proxies to a remote service.`,

            heading: 'Where Does This Actually Help a Working Developer?',
            content: `Three workflows where this is a genuine time-saver, not a novelty:

**1. WebKit-only rendering bugs.** Safari remains the browser where \`backdrop-filter\`, \`position: sticky\` inside certain flex containers, and \`safe-area-inset-*\` on iOS still misbehave compared to Chromium. Before this, catching one of these meant manually opening Safari, reproducing the bug, screenshotting it, and pasting that into a chat window with a description of what looked wrong. Now the agent opens the tab itself and compares the computed styles directly.

**2. Accessibility audits during development, not after.** The built-in accessibility-failure-check tool means an agent can flag a missing \`aria-label\` or a contrast failure *while you're still writing the component*, not three weeks later when a Lighthouse CI job fails in a PR nobody wants to touch.

**3. Autonomous fix-and-verify loops.** Change a CSS rule → reload → screenshot → compare → adjust → repeat, without you as the human relay in the middle of every iteration. This is the same pattern behind [WebMCP's in-page tool exposure](/notes/webmcp-guide-browser-agent-tools-2026), just applied to the browser chrome itself rather than to a page's own JavaScript.

What it is *not*: a replacement for cross-browser end-to-end testing. It's a debugging copilot for one specific engine, not a CI test runner covering Chrome, Firefox, and Safari in one pass.`,

            heading: 'Apple\'s Official Safari MCP vs the Community safari-mcp vs Chrome DevTools MCP',
            content: `| | **Apple Official (STP)** | **Community safari-mcp** | **Chrome DevTools MCP** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Maintainer** | Apple / WebKit team | Independent OSS (achiya-automation + forks) | Google |
| **Works on** | Safari Technology Preview 247+ only | Regular, production Safari | Chrome / Chromium |
| **Driver** | \`safaridriver\` (native WebDriver) | AppleScript + Swift helper | Chrome DevTools Protocol |
| **Tool count** | 16 | 80+ | ~26 (varies by version) |
| **Install** | Built into STP, one terminal command | \`npx safari-mcp\` | \`npx chrome-devtools-mcp\` |
| **Session/cookie reuse** | Yes (STP has its own profile) | Yes (your actual daily Safari) | Yes (your actual daily Chrome) |
| **Available today for most devs** | Only if you run Technology Preview | Yes, any Mac | Yes, any Chrome install |
| **Best for** | First-party WebKit engine access, forward-looking API stability | Broadest tool surface, works now, production Safari | Chromium-specific debugging, largest existing ecosystem |

The practical takeaway: if you're chasing a Safari-specific bug and don't mind installing a second browser build, Apple's official server is the one to trust for API stability going forward — first-party tools don't get abandoned the way community forks sometimes do. If you want it working *today* against the Safari you already use, the community package is the pragmatic choice, at the cost of trusting a third-party AppleScript bridge instead of Apple's own driver.`,

            heading: 'When Should You Skip Apple\'s Safari MCP Server?',
            content: `A few honest limits, since the launch coverage this week has been mostly celebratory:

- **Technology Preview only, not your production Safari.** You can't point this at the Safari your team actually uses without also running a separate STP install — meaning your daily-driver Safari bugs and your STP-testable bugs aren't automatically the same surface.
- **macOS only.** No Windows, no Linux. If your team debugs cross-platform from mixed machines, this only covers the Mac contributors.
- **No documented headless mode.** Every tool description assumes a visible Safari window. That's fine for local dev, but it rules out dropping this straight into a standard CI runner the way you would a headless Playwright job.
- **16 tools is a real gap versus the community package's 80+.** If your workflow depends on deep automation primitives (multi-tab orchestration, complex form-fill sequences, custom event dispatch), you'll hit the ceiling of Apple's tool set faster than you'd expect from a "day one" release.
- **It's brand new.** Three days old as of this post, and Technology Preview builds change fast — don't build a CI dependency on tool names or arguments that Apple hasn't committed to stabilizing yet.

If any of those rule you out today, the community \`safari-mcp\` package or [Chrome DevTools MCP](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) cover more ground right now. None of that makes this a bad release — it makes it a *day-one* release, and day-one releases from browser vendors are usually worth adopting for side projects before you bet a client's CI pipeline on them. If you're evaluating whether a fast-moving AI tool is actually production-ready or still finding its feet, that judgment call is exactly the kind of thing I help teams make when I [build an MVP in six weeks](/services/6-week-mvp) and have to decide what goes in the stack versus what stays on the watch list.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How I\'d Wire This Into My Own Dev Workflow',
            content: `Here's what the launch-day coverage skipped: this isn't going in anyone's CI pipeline yet, and that's fine — it's not built for that today. What it's actually good for is the **local dev loop**, the fifteen minutes before you open a PR.

On this site, rohitraj.tech, I've had exactly the kind of Safari-only bug this tool is built for: a \`backdrop-filter\` blur on a card component that renders correctly in Chrome and subtly clips at the edges in Safari because of how WebKit handles compositing layers differently. Catching that used to mean physically switching to Safari, eyeballing the card, and either living with it or guessing at a fix. With the official MCP server wired into Claude Code, the loop becomes: agent opens the page in STP, screenshots the card, evaluates the computed \`backdrop-filter\` and \`transform\` values via the JS-eval tool, tries a fix, reloads, screenshots again — and I only look at it once it's already converged on something that looks right.

The failure mode I'd actually worry about: treating a Technology Preview screenshot as proof a bug is fixed in the *real* Safari your users run. STP and shipping Safari aren't always pixel-identical, especially for bleeding-edge CSS features. So the rule I'd set for any team adopting this: STP + the MCP server is where you *hunt and fix* WebKit-specific bugs fast, but the final check before merge still happens in the actual Safari version your analytics say your users are on. Skipping that step to save five minutes is how a "fixed in Safari" PR ships a bug that's only fixed in a preview build nobody's users have installed.

That's the same discipline I bring in as a [founding engineer for hire](/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) — adopting a fast-moving tool for the productivity win while drawing a hard line around what it's not yet trusted to verify.`,

            content: `Apple didn't just add a feature — it validated the whole idea that browser vendors should ship first-party MCP servers, three days before this post and with 9+ outlets covering it same-week. That's a signal worth paying attention to even if you never install Safari Technology Preview: expect Firefox and other engines to follow with their own official MCP servers before the year is out.

For today: if you're chasing a WebKit-specific rendering bug and don't mind a second browser install, grab Apple's official server. If you need broader tool coverage against the Safari you already run, the community \`safari-mcp\` package covers more ground right now. Either way, keep a human check against your actual shipping browser before you call a Safari bug fixed.
