For the first time, the question "can I run my coding agent on an open-weights model and not feel it?" has a real answer, and the answer is mostly yes. [GLM-5.2](https://z.ai/blog/glm-5.2) from Z.ai (formerly Zhipu) hit the top of [Hugging Face's trending list](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-5.2) the week it dropped — ~2,500 likes and a community GGUF build within days — and two of the front-page Hacker News threads about it were the same comparison everyone is making: GLM-5.2 vs Claude Opus.

The framing that's gone viral — "0.7 points from the coding king at 1/6 the price" — is half true and half marketing. The capability claim holds up better than I expected. The pricing claim needs a footnote that none of the benchmark-recap posts bother to write, because it changes the actual decision.

This is the builder's read, not a leaderboard recap: what actually shipped, the real code to call GLM-5.2 and drop it into Claude Code (something the comparison posts skip entirely), an honest cost breakdown that accounts for token efficiency, a side-by-side table, when you should *not* switch off Opus, and the hybrid routing setup I'd actually put into production.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'What actually shipped with GLM-5.2?',
            content: `GLM-5.2 is Z.ai's open-weights frontier model, released around **June 16, 2026** under the **MIT license** — which matters more than the benchmark numbers, because MIT means you can self-host it, fine-tune it, and ship it commercially with no usage restrictions. That's the whole reason this comparison is interesting: it's not "a cheaper API," it's "a model you can actually own."

The headline capability is agentic coding. On a set of **45 real coding-agent tasks**, independent testers reported GLM-5.2 producing the same fixes — and crucially the same *failures* — as Opus, which is a stronger signal than a benchmark delta because it means the two models reason similarly on the same inputs. On multi-step tool orchestration over MCP, the gap is **0.8 points** (Opus 4.8 at 77.8%, GLM-5.2 at 77.0%) — functionally a tie for everyday tool-calling work. [VentureBeat reported](https://venturebeat.com/technology/z-ais-open-weights-glm-5-2-beats-gpt-5-5-on-multiple-long-horizon-coding-benchmarks-for-1-6th-the-cost) it beating GPT-5.5 on several long-horizon coding benchmarks outright.

Where Opus still wins is the long tail: multi-hour software-engineering tasks and the hardest tool-use chains, where the analyst consensus is that Opus 4.8 holds its largest margins. Ben Thompson-style benchmark caveats apply — as the interconnects.ai write-up put it, "benchmarks are half dead these days," and the real signal is that GLM-5.2 is the first open model that *feels right in a coding harness as a general agent*. It ships with a claimed **1M-token context window** and deploys on Transformers, vLLM, SGLang, and Unsloth (the GGUF path), so you can run it on your own GPUs or hit Z.ai's hosted API.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How do you actually call GLM-5.2 (and put it in Claude Code)?',
            content: `Here's the part every comparison post skips: the code. Z.ai exposes an **OpenAI-compatible endpoint**, so if you have any OpenAI SDK call in your codebase, switching to GLM-5.2 is a base-URL and model-string change — nothing else moves:

\`\`\`python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-zai-api-key",
    base_url="https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4",  # OpenAI-compatible
)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="glm-5.2",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a senior backend engineer."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a FastAPI rate limiter using Redis."},
    ],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
\`\`\`

But the move most developers actually want is running GLM-5.2 *inside their coding agent*. Z.ai also ships an **Anthropic-compatible endpoint**, which means you can point Claude Code at GLM-5.2 with three environment variables — no new tool, no new workflow:

\`\`\`bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="your-zai-api-key"
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="glm-5.2"

claude   # Claude Code now drives GLM-5.2 instead of Opus
\`\`\`

That's the entire migration for a lot of teams. The same trick works for any tool that reads \`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL\` — including the open-source coding agents I compared in [OpenCode vs Claude Code vs Cursor](/en/notes/opencode-vs-claude-code-cursor-2026). The point worth internalizing: GLM-5.2's value isn't that it's a new thing to learn, it's that it slots into the harness you already use. If you're already running a local-first setup like the one in [best local LLM for coding](/en/notes/best-local-llm-for-coding-replace-cloud-2026), the GGUF build drops in the same way.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'The honest cost breakdown (read this before you switch)',
            content: `This is where the viral "1/6th the cost" number falls apart under load, and where I'd push back on every recap post that quotes it flat.

The **per-token** prices are real and they're a blowout. Per [Z.ai's pricing](https://docs.z.ai/guides/overview/pricing), GLM-5.2 is **$1.40 per million input tokens and $4.40 per million output**, with cached input at **$0.26**. Claude Opus 4.8 is **$5.00 input / $25.00 output**. So per token, GLM-5.2 is **3.6× cheaper on input and 5.7× cheaper on output**. That's where "6× cheaper" comes from.

The footnote nobody writes: **GLM-5.2 is less token-efficient.** Independent testing found it reaches the same answers but spends roughly **3.3× the token-work** getting there — more reasoning, more tool round-trips, more output to express the same fix. So you don't get to multiply the per-token savings directly. Run the math on a realistic agent day:

| | GLM-5.2 | Claude Opus 4.8 |
|---|---|---|
| Per-million input | $1.40 | $5.00 |
| Per-million output | $4.40 | $25.00 |
| Tokens to finish the same task | ~3.3× more | baseline |
| **Net measured cost** | **~46% of Opus** | baseline |

The honest number — the one entelligence.ai measured with prompt caching on — is that GLM-5.2 costs **about 46% of Opus**, i.e. a bit over 2× cheaper net, *not* 6× cheaper. That's still a large saving when you're burning hundreds of dollars a day on an agent fleet. But it reframes the decision: you're trading roughly half your model bill for a small capability gap, not 5/6 of it. For the cost-modelling habit this comes from, see how I broke down [DeepSeek vs Claude vs GPT for India MVPs](/en/notes/deepseek-vs-claude-vs-gpt-india-mvp-cost-2026) — the per-token sticker price is almost never the real number.`,

            content: `Here's the three-way that matters if you're choosing a coding-agent model in mid-2026. AI engines cite tables far more than prose, so this is the part worth bookmarking — and the row most posts leave out is "license," which is the entire reason an open model is even in the conversation.

| Factor | GLM-5.2 | Claude Opus 4.8 | Kimi K2.7 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weights | **Open (MIT)** | Closed | Open |
| Input / output $ per Mtok | $1.40 / $4.40 | $5.00 / $25.00 | low (open) |
| Cached input $ | $0.26 | $0.50 | — |
| MCP tool orchestration | 77.0% | **77.8%** | strong |
| Token efficiency | ~3.3× more tokens | **baseline (best)** | mid |
| Net real-world cost | ~46% of Opus | baseline | low |
| Self-host / fine-tune | **yes** | no | yes |
| Best at | routine agent work, cost-sensitive fleets | hardest long-horizon tasks | open coding alt |
| Drops into Claude Code | yes (Anthropic-compat) | native | via router |

The short version: Opus 4.8 is still the most *capable* and the most *token-efficient* — it wins the hardest tasks and gets there with fewer tokens. GLM-5.2 wins on ownership and on cost-per-outcome for the routine majority of work. If you want the broader open-model landscape, I put GLM's nearest open rival head-to-head with Opus in [Kimi K2.7 vs Claude Opus / GPT](/en/notes/kimi-k2-7-code-vs-claude-opus-gpt-2026) — the open field has gotten genuinely crowded in 2026.`,

            heading: 'When should you stay on Claude Opus 4.8?',
            content: `An honest comparison has to say when *not* to switch. GLM-5.2 is excellent, but there are real cases where Opus 4.8 is the right call and the "just use the cheap one" advice will cost you more than it saves.

**Stay on Opus for the hardest 20%.** On multi-hour software-engineering tasks and the deepest tool-use chains, Opus's margin is widest and most consistent. When a single agent run is doing a large refactor across dozens of files, the token-efficiency gap compounds — GLM's 3.3× token-work means a long autonomous run can actually erode the price advantage *and* take longer wall-clock. For the 20% of tasks where correctness on the first pass is worth more than the model bill, Opus is still the pick. (I went deep on what changed in [Claude Opus 4.8 vs 4.7 for developers](/en/notes/claude-opus-4-8-vs-4-7-developers-2026).)

**Stay if latency matters more than cost.** More token-work means more wall-clock time per task. For an interactive coding session where you're waiting on the agent, Opus finishing in fewer tokens often *feels* better even when GLM is cheaper on paper.

**Don't switch your whole fleet on day one.** A brand-new model — even a great one — has rough edges in real harnesses that benchmarks don't surface. The failure mode I'd worry about: GLM-5.2 looks identical to Opus on your eval set, you cut over 100% of traffic, and then a specific class of tool-use chain quietly degrades in production where you're not watching. The right move isn't all-or-nothing — it's routing, which is the next section.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How I\'d ship GLM-5.2 in production (the hybrid routing setup)',
            content: `The recap posts end at "GLM is cheaper, mostly." The actual engineering question is *how* you capture 80% of the savings without betting your output quality on a week-old model. The answer is a router, not a switch — and this is the wiring I'd put in, drawn from running LLM features for [myFinancial](/en/notes/openai-vs-claude-vs-gemini-api-cost-india-mvp-2026) and client agent systems.

**Route by task difficulty, not globally.** Send the routine majority — boilerplate, single-file edits, test generation, straightforward tool calls — to GLM-5.2, and reserve Opus for the hard, long-horizon, or high-stakes tasks. A thin classifier in front of the agent does the routing:

\`\`\`python
def pick_model(task):
    hard = task.touches_many_files or task.is_long_horizon or task.is_high_stakes
    return "claude-opus-4-8" if hard else "glm-5.2"
\`\`\`

Even a crude heuristic captures most of the win, because the 80/20 split is real: most agent invocations are routine. This is the same provider-agnostic-with-fallback pattern I bake into every [6-week MVP](/en/services/6-week-mvp), and it's exactly what a router like LiteLLM or Portkey is for — I covered that layer in [OpenRouter vs LiteLLM vs Portkey](/en/notes/openrouter-vs-litellm-vs-portkey-india-mvp-2026).

**Keep Opus as a fallback, not just a tier.** When a GLM-5.2 run fails a self-check — tests don't pass, the diff doesn't apply, the tool chain stalls — retry that *specific* task on Opus rather than failing the user. You pay the Opus price only on the tasks GLM couldn't close, which is the cheapest possible way to buy back the capability gap.

**Instrument the per-task cost, not the per-token price.** The whole point of this post is that per-token price lies. Log tokens-in, tokens-out, and wall-clock *per completed task* for both models on your real workload, and let that decide your routing thresholds — not a vendor's benchmark. Getting this measurement right on the first pass is most of what [founding-engineer work](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) on an AI product actually is: not the happy-path call, but the routing, the fallback, and the cost telemetry that tell you whether the cheap model is actually cheaper for *your* tasks.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'The bottom line: switch or stay?',
            content: `Switch the routine majority of your coding-agent traffic to GLM-5.2, and do it through a router with an Opus fallback — not a global cutover. The capability is genuinely close (77.0% vs 77.8% on MCP tool orchestration, same fixes and failures on real tasks), the weights are MIT-licensed so you can own and self-host the model, and the net cost lands around **46% of Opus** once you account for the ~3.3× token-inefficiency. That's a real, bankable saving on a high-volume agent fleet.

Stay on Opus 4.8 for the hardest 20% — long-horizon refactors, the deepest tool chains, anything where first-pass correctness or latency beats the model bill. And ignore the flat "6× cheaper" headline; the honest number is "a bit over 2× cheaper net, with a small capability gap on hard tasks," which is a much better basis for a decision than a benchmark screenshot.

The deeper shift: an open-weights model is now a credible default for the routine 80% of agent work, which would have sounded absurd a year ago. The teams that win aren't the ones who pick GLM *or* Opus — they're the ones who route between them and measure per-task cost. If you want a hand wiring a multi-model coding agent that routes by difficulty, falls back cleanly, and actually tracks what each task costs, that's exactly the kind of work I do.`,
