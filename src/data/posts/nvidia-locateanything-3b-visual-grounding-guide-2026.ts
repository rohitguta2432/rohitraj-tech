    excerpt:
        'NVIDIA quietly shipped LocateAnything-3B on May 26, 2026 — a 3B open-weights vision-language model that turns a plain-English phrase like "the submit button" into exact pixel boxes, no fixed class list, no retraining. It grounds objects, GUI elements, and text with up to 2.5x higher throughput than older box-by-box decoders. By early July it had crossed 1.2M Hugging Face downloads. Here is what actually changed, runnable code to try it, how it stacks up against YOLO / Grounding DINO / Florence-2 / Qwen2.5-VL, and the license catch that will stop you shipping it to production if you are not careful.',

Unlike YOLO, there is **no fixed class list**: you ask for "the red error toast" or "the second row's delete icon" and it points at it. Its **Parallel Box Decoding** predicts a whole box in one step for **up to 2.5x higher throughput** than token-by-token decoders. It had passed **1.2M Hugging Face downloads by early July 2026**. The catch: it ships under a **non-commercial research license**, so it is a prototyping and research tool, not a drop-in for your paid product — plan your grounding layer accordingly.`,

For a decade, "detect this thing in an image" meant training a detector on a fixed list of classes. YOLO is brilliant at that, but it only knows the labels you trained it on — ask it for "the Add to Cart button that turns grey when the form is invalid" and it has nothing to say. The moment you needed an open-ended, describe-it-in-words query, you were stuck stitching together a captioner, a segmenter, and a lot of glue.

**NVIDIA's LocateAnything-3B, released on May 26, 2026, collapses that whole pipeline into one model.** You hand it an image and a plain-English description; it hands back precise bounding boxes or points. It handles referring-expression grounding, multi-object detection, GUI element localization, scene-text detection, and point-based pointing — all from a single 3B checkpoint. By the first week of July 2026 it had crossed **1.2M downloads on Hugging Face** with 2,600+ likes, and the reason is simple: it is the first open grounding model that feels good enough to actually build an agent's "eyes" on.

Why this matters right now: 2026 is the year of the computer-use agent, and every one of them has the same weak link — turning "click the checkout button" into an (x, y) the automation layer can act on. That is exactly what visual grounding is. Below is what actually shipped, code to run it in ten minutes, an honest comparison against the models you are probably already using, where it falls down, and the license reality that decides whether you can ship it.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'What Is Actually New in LocateAnything-3B?',
            content: `LocateAnything-3B is not a from-scratch architecture — it is a smart assembly. The language model is **Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct**, the vision encoder is NVIDIA's **MoonViT-SO-400M**, and an MLP projector bridges them. That is a conventional VLM recipe. The interesting part is what NVIDIA did to the output stage.

Standard VLMs emit coordinates the same way they emit prose: one token at a time, left to right. To output \`<box>412, 88, 530, 140</box>\` the model runs the decoder through every digit. For dense scenes with dozens of objects, that autoregressive crawl is the bottleneck.

**Parallel Box Decoding (PBD)** is NVIDIA's fix. Instead of predicting coordinates digit-by-digit, PBD predicts a complete box in a single decoding step, which the model card reports delivers **up to 2.5x higher throughput** than autoregressive baselines — while *improving* high-IoU (tight, accurate) localization rather than trading it away. That combination, faster *and* tighter, is what makes it practical for real workloads.

A few concrete specs worth knowing before you build against it:

- **Input:** RGB images at native resolution up to **2.5K**, plus text prompts up to **24K tokens** — enough to describe many targets in one call.
- **Output:** structured text with semantic labels and coordinate tokens — \`<box>x1, y1, x2, y2</box>\` for boxes, \`<box>x, y</box>\` for points.
- **Training scale:** a **138M-sample** multi-domain dataset spanning natural images, documents, GUIs, and dense scenes — that breadth is why one checkpoint covers so many tasks.
- **Three inference modes:** \`fast\` (multi-token prediction only), \`slow\` (full autoregressive), and \`hybrid\` (the default, balancing speed and accuracy).

The design intent is unusually clear: NVIDIA built one generalist that replaces a stack of specialized detectors. You can read the full breakdown on the [official model card](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/LocateAnything-3B).`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How Do You Actually Run LocateAnything-3B?',
            content: `The model loads through Hugging Face Transformers with \`trust_remote_code\` (NVIDIA ships custom modeling code for PBD). Here is the smallest useful example — load the model, ground a phrase, and get boxes back:

\`\`\`python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoProcessor
from PIL import Image

model_id = "nvidia/LocateAnything-3B"
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    model_id, trust_remote_code=True, dtype="auto", device_map="cuda"
)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True)

image = Image.open("checkout_page.png").convert("RGB")
prompt = "the primary Place Order button"

inputs = processor(images=image, text=prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
# mode: "fast" | "slow" | "hybrid" (default)
out = model.generate(**inputs, mode="hybrid", max_new_tokens=256)
print(processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
# -> "Place Order <box>612, 940, 812, 998</box>"
\`\`\`

The output is text you parse, not a JSON blob, so you need one small regex to lift the coordinates out. That is the part every "look how easy it is" demo skips, so here it is:

\`\`\`python
import re

def parse_boxes(text, img_w, img_h):
    # coordinates are absolute pixels in the model's canonical space
    boxes = []
    for m in re.finditer(r"<box>\\s*(\\d+),\\s*(\\d+),\\s*(\\d+),\\s*(\\d+)\\s*</box>", text):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, m.groups())
        boxes.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    return boxes

click_x = (612 + 812) // 2   # -> 712
click_y = (940 + 998) // 2   # -> 969
\`\`\`

That center-point is what you feed to your automation layer — Playwright, a robot arm, an accessibility overlay. Start with \`hybrid\` mode; only drop to \`fast\` once you have measured that your scenes are simple enough to survive the accuracy hit. If you are wiring this into an agent loop, keep the raw model text in your logs — when a grounding call misfires, the label the model emitted alongside the box tells you *why* it pointed where it did.`,

            heading: 'Where Does Open-Vocabulary Grounding Actually Win?',
            content: `Visual grounding is not a research toy — it removes real glue code from four workflows I see constantly:

**Computer-use and browser agents.** This is the headline use case. An agent decides "click Submit"; LocateAnything turns that intent into a pixel target on the actual rendered screenshot. It benchmarks on **ScreenSpot-Pro**, a GUI-grounding suite, precisely because NVIDIA is aiming at the agent market. If you have been fighting brittle CSS selectors that break every time a frontend ships, grounding against pixels is a genuinely different, more resilient approach — and it pairs naturally with the [computer-use models I compared here](/notes/gemini-computer-use-vs-claude-openai-2026).

**Document intelligence.** Because it does scene-text and layout localization, you can ask "the total amount due" on an invoice and get the box, then crop-and-OCR just that region instead of running OCR over the whole page and hoping the parser guesses right. It slots in next to the [multimodal document models I looked at recently](/notes/deepseek-v4-vision-cheapest-multimodal-api-2026).

**Visual QA and data extraction.** Scraping structured data out of screenshots, dashboards, or charts — "find every red status pill" — is a one-prompt job instead of a bespoke detector per layout.

**Robotics and the long tail.** Point-based localization ("point at the mug handle") and strong performance on dense, cluttered scenes are why the robotics crowd is paying attention. The value is the same everywhere: **you never retrain for a new object.** The vocabulary is open, so the thing you want to find today does not need to have existed in any training label.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'LocateAnything-3B vs YOLO vs Grounding DINO vs Florence-2 vs Qwen2.5-VL',
            content: `The honest framing is not "LocateAnything replaces YOLO" — they solve different problems. YOLO is a closed-vocabulary speed demon; LocateAnything is an open-vocabulary grounder. Here is how the realistic alternatives line up:

| Model | Params | Open-vocab (text query)? | GUI grounding | Commercial license? | Best for |
|-------|--------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| YOLOv12 (Ultralytics) | ~3M–60M | No — fixed classes | No | AGPL-3.0 / paid | Real-time detection of known classes |
| Grounding DINO | ~172M | Yes | Weak | Apache-2.0 (yes) | Open-vocab boxes you can ship commercially |
| Florence-2 (large) | 0.77B | Yes | Some | MIT (yes) | Lightweight multi-task, edge-friendly |
| Qwen2.5-VL-3B | 3B | Yes | Decent | Apache-2.0 (yes) | General VLM that also grounds |
| **LocateAnything-3B** | 3B | Yes | **Strong (ScreenSpot-Pro)** | **No — research only** | Highest-precision grounding + 2.5x speed |

Two columns decide most real projects. **GUI grounding** is where LocateAnything's PBD and training focus pull ahead of general VLMs like Qwen2.5-VL — if you are building an agent that reads screens, that edge is the whole point. But look one column right: the **commercial license** column is where the story flips. Every alternative in that table can go into a product you charge money for. LocateAnything-3B, as of July 2026, cannot. That single fact reshapes how you should design around it.`,

        {
            heading: 'When Should You Skip LocateAnything-3B?',
            content: `I like this model, and I would still tell several teams to walk away from it. Here is when.

**You are shipping a commercial product.** LocateAnything-3B is released under **NVIDIA's non-commercial research license** — academic and non-profit research only. The weights are open; the *rights* are not. If your grounding call sits inside a feature customers pay for, you are exposed, and "but it was on Hugging Face" is not a license. For anything commercial, reach for **Grounding DINO** or **Qwen2.5-VL** (both Apache-2.0) or **Florence-2** (MIT) instead. This is the single most important thing to internalize, and it is exactly the detail every breathless "goodbye YOLO" post leaves out.

**Your classes are fixed and you need real-time.** If you are detecting the same 5 objects at 60 FPS on an edge device, a fine-tuned YOLO will be smaller, faster, and cheaper. Open vocabulary is power you are paying for with a 3B model and a GPU; do not buy it if you do not need it.

**You cannot host a 3B model.** At fp16 the weights alone want roughly **6-8 GB of VRAM** before activations, and you will want a real GPU for usable latency. There is no official hosted API — self-hosting is the deal. If you have no GPU budget, a hosted VLM with grounding will get you further faster.

**A note on what it does not do:** it grounds, it does not segment (no pixel masks, just boxes/points) and it does not track across video frames. And like every VLM it will occasionally hallucinate a confident box for something that is not there — so in any automated loop, validate the coordinates before you act on them.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How I Would Ship Visual Grounding in Production',
            content: `Here is the build I would actually reach for, and the trap I would design around from day one.

The thing I want is a **self-hosted "screenshot-to-coordinate" service** for a browser agent: it takes a rendered screenshot plus an intent ("click the Place Order button"), returns a click target, and the automation layer acts. LocateAnything-3B is the best open model for the grounding step today — so it is what I would prototype on to prove the UX works.

But I would put the grounding call **behind an interface from the very first commit**, something as dumb as \`ground(image, phrase) -> (x, y)\`. Why: the non-commercial license means the day this goes into a paying product, LocateAnything has to come out. If the model is hidden behind that interface, swapping to **Grounding DINO** (Apache-2.0) or **Qwen2.5-VL** for the commercial build is a one-file change, not a rewrite. The failure mode I have watched teams walk into is hard-coding a research-licensed model into ten call sites and discovering the license problem the week before launch. Architect for the swap now; it costs you nothing today.

Two integration details the README will not warn you about. First, **the model outputs text, not structured data** — budget for the parser and, more importantly, for the case where the parse *fails* because the model narrated instead of emitting a box; your service needs a "no confident target" path, not a crash. Second, **coordinates are in the model's canonical image space**, so if you resized or letterboxed the screenshot before inference, you must map the box back to real display pixels before you click — an off-by-a-scale-factor here sends every click to the wrong place and it is maddening to debug. This kind of unglamorous plumbing is where AI features actually get won or lost — it is most of what I do when I [ship a real MVP in six weeks](/services/6-week-mvp), and it is exactly the layer teams underestimate when they [bring on a founding engineer](/services/hire-founding-engineer-india).`,

Just remember the two rules — **it is research-licensed, so keep it swappable**, and **it grounds, it does not segment or track.** Build behind an interface, validate the boxes before you act, and you will get the upside without the launch-week surprise.

If you are wiring visual grounding, computer-use, or any AI feature into a product and want the plumbing done right the first time, that is exactly what I do.
