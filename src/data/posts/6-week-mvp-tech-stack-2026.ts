If you spend a week debating Next.js vs Remix, Postgres vs Mongo, or Vercel vs Fly, you have already lost 16% of your 6-week sprint. The right MVP stack in 2026 is opinionated, conservative, and boring on purpose. Every decision below is one I have shipped 5+ MVPs on. The reasoning is in the post — but the executive answer is: pick the boring choice every time.

The wrong question to ask before an MVP is "what is the best stack?". The right question is "what is the stack with the most documentation, the largest hiring pool, and the fewest gotchas at the 1,000-user mark?". That stack in 2026 is unambiguous. It has been unambiguous for 18 months.

This is the exact stack I run on every 6-week MVP sprint. It covers SaaS, AI products, internal tools, marketplaces, and content sites. It does not cover: iOS-native apps, real-time multiplayer games, on-device ML, or anything that needs sub-10ms latency at the edge. For 95% of MVPs, none of those constraints apply.`

      heading: 'Frontend: Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind 4',
      content: `Next.js 16 with the App Router is the default in 2026. It is not the trendy pick — it is the boring pick that has 4 years of production scars worked out. Server components for static content, client components for interactivity, server actions for forms. No GraphQL ceremony, no API client generation, no Redux.

Why Next.js over Remix or SvelteKit: Vercel hosts Next.js for free at MVP scale, the docs are exhaustive, the hiring pool is enormous, and the App Router model has stabilized. Remix has a smaller ecosystem; SvelteKit is great but you cannot easily hire SvelteKit engineers in India. The boring choice wins.

TypeScript is non-negotiable. Plain JavaScript MVPs hit type-related bugs at user 50 and you lose a week debugging. Strict mode on, no \`any\`. Use \`zod\` for runtime validation at API boundaries — it doubles as your API contract.

Tailwind 4 with shadcn/ui or DaisyUI for components. Do not roll your own design system in a 6-week sprint. shadcn ships 50+ accessible primitives that look professional out of the box. Custom design happens in v2 when you have users to design for.

Avoid in v1: Storybook (too much overhead), CSS-in-JS (Tailwind ships faster), tRPC (Next.js server actions are simpler), GraphQL (overkill at MVP scale).`
    },
    {
      heading: 'Backend: Next.js API Routes or Spring Boot (Pick by Use Case)',
      content: `For most SaaS MVPs, Next.js API routes + server actions are the entire backend. No separate service. No microservices. One codebase, one deploy, one mental model. Founders love this because there is no infra to babysit.

When to use Spring Boot instead: if your domain is heavy on stateful background jobs (large queues, scheduled batch processes, complex transactional logic), Spring Boot + Java is more predictable than Next.js for the backend. I default to Spring Boot for fintech (audit logs, transaction guarantees), healthcare (HIPAA-aware request handling), and AI products with heavy provider orchestration.

For everything else, Next.js handles it. The backend is route handlers in \`/api/*\` or server actions in \`/actions/*\`. Both run on Vercel's serverless infrastructure. Cold starts in 2026 are sub-200ms. You will not feel them at MVP scale.

Authentication: Supabase Auth, Clerk, or NextAuth. I default to Supabase Auth because it integrates with the Postgres row-level security model. Clerk has a better pre-built UI but adds vendor lock-in. NextAuth is fine for simple cases.

Avoid in v1: NestJS (over-architected), separate microservices (every service is another deploy), gRPC (no MVP needs binary protocols), Kafka (overkill until you actually have events at scale).`
    },
    {
      heading: 'Database: Postgres (Supabase or RDS), Period.',
      content: `Use Postgres. If you are unsure, use Postgres. If your friend who built a side project says Mongo is faster, ignore them. Postgres in 2026 is the default for the same reason it has been since 2018: it does everything well, the ecosystem is enormous, and you will not regret it at scale.

Supabase or RDS depending on the team:
- **Supabase**: better for solo founders. Includes auth, storage, real-time, and a generous free tier. Postgres under the hood, with row-level security exposed via a PostgREST API. Vercel-friendly.
- **AWS RDS**: better when you need full control, when you already have AWS infrastructure, or when compliance requires VPC isolation. More expensive, more setup.

For 95% of MVPs, Supabase wins. I default to it unless the founder has a specific reason for AWS.

Schema design: keep it normalized in v1. Denormalize in v2 when you have actual query patterns. Use \`text\` for variable-length strings, \`timestamptz\` for dates, \`uuid\` for primary keys, \`jsonb\` for flexible payloads (sparingly). Migrations in version control via Supabase CLI or Flyway/Liquibase if Spring Boot.

Avoid in v1: Mongo (you will regret it once you need joins), DynamoDB (overkill at MVP scale, complex pricing), MySQL (Postgres is strictly better in 2026), separate read replicas (premature).`
    },
    {
      heading: 'Hosting: Vercel for Next.js, AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Fly.io for Spring Boot',
      content: `Vercel is the default for Next.js MVPs. The free tier covers MVP scale. The pro tier ($20/month) covers most projects post-launch. Auto-deploys from GitHub, preview URLs for every PR, edge functions if you need them.

For Spring Boot backends:
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: good if you already have AWS, ugly UI but reliable
- **Fly.io**: simpler, more developer-friendly, great Postgres integration via Fly Postgres
- **Railway / Render**: also fine for simpler Spring Boot deploys

Avoid in v1: Kubernetes (you do not need it, you will not need it for 18 months), self-managed VPS (sysadmin work eats sprint time), AWS ECS / EKS (over-architected for one container).

For static assets and uploads: Supabase Storage if using Supabase, S3 + CloudFront if using AWS. Cloudflare R2 is a good cost-saver for high-egress projects.

For email: Resend (newer, cleaner DX) or SendGrid (more battle-tested). Both work. I default to Resend for new projects.

For payments: Stripe internationally, Razorpay for India-first products. Both have hosted checkout flows that handle 90% of edge cases. Build custom checkout only when you have a specific reason.

For monitoring: Sentry for errors, Vercel Analytics or Plausible for product analytics, Better Stack or Logtail for log aggregation.`

      heading: 'AI Integration: One Provider, One Pattern, Done',
      content: `If your MVP needs AI, pick one provider for v1 and integrate it cleanly. Do not multi-provider in v1. Multi-provider abstractions are real engineering work and they are wasted effort until you actually have a cost-or-availability problem.

In 2026, the boring AI picks:
- **General-purpose LLM**: Claude Sonnet 4.6 or GPT-5.4 via the official SDK. Both are stable, fast, and well-documented.
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small or Cohere embed-v3. Pick one, do not switch.
- **Image generation**: Gemini Nano Banana for cheap, OpenAI DALL-E for quality, Midjourney via API for art-direction.
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs for synthesis, Whisper for transcription. Boring picks.
- **Vector store**: pgvector inside your existing Postgres. Do not bring in a separate vector DB at MVP scale.

Pattern: one provider client, wrapped in one service file (\`/lib/ai/client.ts\`), called from server actions or API routes. Caching with Vercel KV or Postgres unlogged tables. Streaming via Vercel AI SDK if the UX needs it.

Avoid in v1: LangChain (too much abstraction for a 6-week sprint), agent frameworks (build the agent loop yourself in 50 lines), self-hosted LLMs (operationally expensive), fine-tuning (rarely worth it pre-PMF).

If you do not need AI in v1, do not add it. "AI-powered" is not a feature. A feature is what the user does with the AI.`

    {
      heading: 'Mobile: React Native + Expo, Only If You Need It in v1',
      content: `99% of MVPs do not need a native mobile app in v1. A responsive web app on the user's phone covers the demo, the early adopters, and the ProductHunt launch. Native apps are a separate sprint that adds 4-8 weeks.

If you do need a native app in v1 — typically for offline-first products, push notifications as the core mechanic, or app-store distribution as the primary growth channel — the boring choice is React Native + Expo SDK 53+. EAS Build for cloud builds, EAS Update for OTA updates, expo-router for navigation, react-native-mmkv for local storage.

Avoid in v1: Native iOS / Android with separate codebases (twice the work), Flutter (smaller hiring pool in India, larger binaries), Cordova / Capacitor (slower, less native-feeling), self-hosted EAS replacements (use EAS for the sprint).

The decision tree:
- Web is acceptable for demo and launch → web only, native in v2
- Native is required for the core mechanic (e.g., a fitness tracker, scanner, or app-only product) → React Native + Expo from day one
- iOS-only or Android-only is fine for v1 → still React Native + Expo, ship to one store first

This stack ships native apps in 4-6 weeks once the web MVP exists. Standalone native sprint at $20K-$40K depending on complexity.

      heading: 'The 2026 Boring-Stack Cheat Sheet',
      content: `If you read nothing else, this is the table:

| Layer | Default Pick | When to Switch |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Frontend | Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind | Never in MVP |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui or DaisyUI | If you have a design system already |
| Backend | Next.js server actions | Spring Boot for fintech / heavy backend |
| Database | Postgres (Supabase) | RDS for AWS-shop, never Mongo |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | Clerk if you need pre-built UI |
| Hosting | Vercel | Fly.io / Railway for non-Next backends |
| Email | Resend | SendGrid for legacy needs |
| Payments | Stripe (intl) / Razorpay (India) | UPI direct only if scale demands |
| Monitoring | Sentry + Plausible | Datadog at $1M ARR |
| AI Provider | Claude or GPT | Both — but only after MVP |
| Mobile | None in v1 → RN + Expo in v2 | Only if app-only growth channel |

Every choice in this table is replaceable. None of them is replaceable in 6 weeks. The MVP stack is the stack you can ship without research time. The trendy stack is the stack that costs you a week of unbillable learning.
