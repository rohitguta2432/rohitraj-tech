Bolt's complex-app success rate drops to 31% past a complexity threshold. Founders have publicly burned 5–8 million tokens (80% of monthly quota) fixing one Supabase auth bug. A senior developer at $40/hr fixes the same bug in 90 minutes for $60.

This crossover doesn't apply if your app stays simple, internal-only, or never sees production users — Bolt is genuinely cheaper there.`,

      content: `By [Rohit Raj](/en/about) — AI Consultant · Forward Deployed Engineer · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitraj2/)

If your project will stay under 10K lines of code, has no payment edge cases, and you are still proving the idea, Bolt.new at $25 per month beats hiring a developer every time. The crossover happens the moment you onboard real users — Bolt's complex-app success rate drops to 31% above a certain complexity threshold, and a single Supabase auth bug routinely burns 5 to 8 million tokens before it is fixed. At that point a senior developer at $40 per hour for two weeks is cheaper than the token refill plus your lost weekend.

The cost math nobody runs is this: Bolt's $25 per month gets you 10 million tokens, which sounds infinite until you watch one stuck bug eat a third of it. Founders on Reddit have publicly logged 8 million tokens burned in three hours fighting one auth bug — that is 80% of a monthly quota gone in an afternoon. A developer who has shipped 20 production apps fixes that same bug in 90 minutes for $60. The price of "AI is cheaper" is paying for failed attempts.

The real question is not "which is cheaper". It is "which has a lower total cost of ownership in 2026 once you count token waste, rebuild risk, and your time". This post answers that with real numbers — what Bolt does well, where it predictably breaks, what a [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp) costs by comparison, and how to know which side of the line your project is on before you commit.`,

      heading: 'What Bolt.new Actually Costs Once You Hit Real Users',
      content: `Bolt's pricing tiers look generous on the marketing site and brutal on the receipt. Free tier ships with a 300K daily and 1M monthly token cap that depletes in 3 to 4 days of active development. The $25/month Pro plan kills the daily cap and gives you 10M tokens monthly. Sounds like enough — until you do the math on what one bug actually costs.

Here is what a Pro plan token budget looks like in practice, based on what founders publicly report:

| Activity | Tokens used | % of monthly quota |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Generate initial MVP scaffold | 200K | 2% |
| Add authentication (clean path) | 400K | 4% |
| Fix Stripe webhook double-firing bug | 1.2M | 12% |
| Fix one tough Supabase RLS policy | 2M | 20% |
| Fix Supabase auth that loops on iOS Safari | 5M–8M | 50–80% |
| Refactor when Bolt regenerates broken code | 1.5M per attempt | 15% per attempt |
| Add a real test suite | 800K | 8% |
| Migrate from SQLite to Postgres | 1.5M | 15% |

The $25/month plan covers a clean MVP from scratch with maybe two minor bug fixes. It does not cover one stuck production bug. The $50/month tier doubles the quota; founders who hit real users typically jump to that within 60 days. The $200/month tier is where serious solo builders end up — and at that point you are paying $2,400 per year for a tool that still cannot debug what it built six weeks ago on an older model checkpoint.

By comparison, a senior developer at the [hire-founding-engineer-india](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) rate of around $40 per hour, working 4 hours per week on retainer, costs $640 per month. They debug with full repo context, fix root causes instead of symptoms, and the code stays fixed because a human who understands the system wrote the patch.

The honest line: Bolt is cheaper for the first month. By month three on a real product, the token bill plus your time fighting it usually exceeds a part-time developer.`,

    {
      heading: 'Where Bolt.new Predictably Breaks (and Why)',
      content: `Bolt's real failure mode is documented and reproducible — complex SaaS applications hit a 31% success rate threshold beyond about 90 minutes of work and 120K tokens spent. Below that threshold Bolt is genuinely magical. Above it the tool starts regenerating broken code, hallucinating function signatures, and forgetting context from earlier in the conversation. This is not a Bolt bug — it is the limit of how far a coding agent can drift from its original plan before quality collapses.

The five failure modes that show up over and over:

| Failure | Where it happens | Why Bolt cannot fix it |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Auth flow breaks on mobile Safari | Cookie config, third-party cookie blocks | Needs deep browser knowledge Bolt does not have |
| Supabase RLS leaks user data | Policy interactions across tables | Requires reading 8 files at once + holding all in working memory |
| Stripe webhook double-fires | Idempotency, signature validation | Bolt regenerates handler each fix, loses prior state |
| Postgres queries slow at 10K rows | Query plans, index design | Optimization needs production data Bolt cannot see |
| Deploys randomly fail | Env vars, edge function cold starts | Multi-system debugging Bolt is not equipped for |

Every one of these requires reading existing code and reasoning about why it broke — exactly the operation where AI agents lose accuracy. Bolt's strength is generating new code from a clean prompt. Its weakness is editing code it already shipped, especially when the bug is interaction-level (two systems disagreeing) instead of single-file.

The other quiet failure mode: Bolt cannot run on your repo if it grew on Cursor or by hand. Once your code base outgrows the Bolt sandbox, you are in normal-developer territory whether you wanted to be or not. Most founders learn this around month three, after they exported the code to "make a small change locally" and realised they cannot import it back cleanly.

This is not theoretical. I run [Lovable rescue contracts](/en/notes/lovable-alternative-developer-when-ai-builder-breaks) and [Supabase RLS audits](/en/notes/supabase-rls-production-bugs-need-real-engineer-2026) — the exact failure profile shows up identically on Bolt projects. The tool is different. The bugs are the same.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'What a Developer Costs vs Bolt — The Real Crossover',
      content: `Here is the cost crossover most founders find a quarter too late. Bolt at $25 to $200 per month feels infinite until the project stops scaffolding new features and starts maintaining existing ones. The moment you spend more time fixing than building, Bolt's price model inverts — every fix costs tokens, and tokens are not refundable when the fix did not work.

Direct comparison on a real 2026 MVP build:

| Path | Cost (3 months) | What you get | Risk |
|------|-----------------|--------------|------|
| Bolt $25 plan only | $75 | Working prototype, fragile in production | High — ships without test suite, hard to hand off |
| Bolt $200 plan only | $600 | Same prototype, more iteration headroom | Same — token quota does not buy quality |
| Bolt $25 + 1 dev sprint | $25 + $5,000 = $5,025 | Bolt MVP hardened by a developer | Low — you get a 30-day support window after handoff |
| 6-Week MVP Sprint (no AI builder) | $15,000–$30,000 | Production-ready Next.js + Postgres + tests + CI/CD | Lowest — fixed scope, fixed price, full GitHub ownership |
| Hire founding engineer (retainer) | $5,000–$10,000/month | Continuous build + fix, full system context | Lowest — same person owns the codebase end-to-end |

The honest crossover threshold:

- **Pre-product, no users, idea validation**: Bolt $25 plan wins. Save the developer money for later.
- **MVP with first 50 to 200 users**: Bolt + 1-week developer sprint ($5K) is the cheapest path to "doesn't break".
- **MVP with paying users and recurring bugs**: 6-week MVP rebuild ($15K to $30K) is cheaper than continuing to fight Bolt.
- **SaaS with complex auth, payments, RLS, multi-tenant**: never start on Bolt. The hardening bill at the end ($5K to $40K per industry estimates) is more than just hiring a developer for 4 weeks up front.

The trap most founders fall into: they spend $600 on Bolt across 3 months, hit a wall, then spend $20K rebuilding what Bolt produced. The $600 is sunk cost. The honest cost of "Bolt got us started" is usually $20K + 3 months of opportunity cost — not $600.

If your project is anywhere on the right side of the crossover, ship it the [6-week MVP sprint way](/en/services/6-week-mvp) from day one. The first attempt is the cheap one.`,

      heading: 'Bolt.new vs Hiring a Developer — Side-by-Side',
      content: `The straight comparison most founders want, with the parts the marketing pages skip:

| Factor | Bolt.new | Hire a Developer |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Time to first prototype | 30–90 minutes | 1–3 days |
| Cost month 1 | $25–$200 | $4,000–$10,000 |
| Cost month 6 (with users) | $1,200 + $20K rebuild | $24,000–$60,000 |
| Code quality at 10K LOC | Inconsistent, regenerated patterns | Hand-written, tested, documented |
| Bug fix latency | Hours of token-burning, sometimes fails | 90 minutes, fixed root cause |
| You own the GitHub repo | Yes (export) but maintenance is hard | Yes, fully — clean commits, branch history |
| Test suite included | Rare unless you ask explicitly | Standard, written alongside code |
| Production deploy pipeline | Bolt cloud or basic Netlify/Vercel | Custom CI/CD, monitoring, rollback |
| Handles Supabase RLS edge cases | Often misses cross-table policy bugs | Reads all 8 files, traces interaction |
| Handles Stripe edge cases | Idempotency commonly missed | Standard practice, never missed |
| AI Overviews citation likelihood | Low — code samples are too generic | High — case studies + specifics |
| Fits regulated industries (HIPAA, PCI) | No, missing audit and review trail | Yes, with compliance-aware engineer |
| Scales to 10K+ users | Rarely without rebuild | Yes with proper Postgres + Redis design |

The pattern: Bolt wins month 1, breaks even month 2, loses by month 3 on any project with real users. A developer is more expensive on day 1 and cheaper on day 90.

For founders who want both — speed of Bolt plus quality of a developer — the working pattern is to scaffold the first prototype on Bolt for $25, validate the idea with 20 to 50 users in two weeks, then hand the export to a developer for a [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp) that rebuilds it properly. You spend $25 + $20K instead of $200 + $20K and you avoid 3 months of debugging the AI builder's mistakes.`,

    {
      heading: 'When Bolt.new Is Genuinely the Right Choice',
      content: `Bolt is not a bad tool. It is a great tool used in the wrong place. Here is when it is the correct call, and I will tell founders this without trying to sell them an MVP sprint:

**Use Bolt.new if:**
- You are pre-product, pre-users, validating whether anyone wants the thing.
- The app is internal-only or under 10 users for the foreseeable future.
- You have no payment logic or only Stripe Checkout's hosted flow.
- You have no auth more complex than email + password + Google OAuth.
- You will not store regulated data (no HIPAA, no PCI, no GDPR data residency requirements).
- You are technical enough to read the generated code and fix small bugs yourself.
- The hackathon deadline is tomorrow morning.

**Do not use Bolt.new if:**
- You already have paying users and the app is part of your revenue.
- You have any custom auth — SSO, SAML, magic links, multi-step signup flows.
- You handle payments beyond Stripe Checkout (subscriptions, invoicing, marketplaces).
- Your data has regulatory exposure (medical, financial, EU/India residency).
- You need mobile push notifications (Bolt is web-first by design).
- You expect to have a team of more than one developer in 6 months.
- The product is differentiated by a backend pattern (queues, workflows, multi-step jobs).

The honest pattern: Bolt is best for the first 30 days. After that, the tool's strengths stop compounding and its weaknesses start. A developer is the inverse — slow on day 1, faster every day after as they learn your system. The transition point is typically week 3 to 4 of any project that survives initial validation.

For everything in between, the answer is the [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp): one developer, fixed scope, fixed price, production-ready output. Or, if you want continuous capacity instead of a one-shot sprint, [hire a founding engineer in India](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) on retainer at a fraction of US salary cost.`,

      heading: 'The 5-Step Decision Tree — Bolt or Developer?',
      content: `Run this checklist before paying anyone — Bolt subscription or developer retainer. It takes five minutes and saves most founders a month of wrong-direction work:

**Step 1 — Have you validated the idea?**
- No → Bolt $25. Burn 20% of your token quota proving the idea, validate with 20 strangers, then revisit.
- Yes → Continue.

**Step 2 — Do you have any users today?**
- No, idea is new → Bolt $25 plan. Stay there until you have 20 paying users.
- Yes, < 50 users → Bolt $50–$200 plan, plan to add a developer at 100 users.
- Yes, > 50 users with bugs → Skip Bolt. Hire a developer for a 1-week stabilization ($5K).

**Step 3 — Does your app touch payments, auth, or regulated data?**
- No to all three → Bolt is fine, even at scale.
- Yes to any one → 6-week MVP sprint or developer retainer. Bolt's failure modes here cost more than the developer.

**Step 4 — How long is the runway?**
- Less than 3 months → Bolt + 1-week developer sprint. Speed matters more than perfection.
- 3 to 12 months → 6-week MVP sprint. Cheapest total cost path.
- 12+ months → Founding engineer retainer. Capacity over time wins.

**Step 5 — Will you hire a CTO or technical co-founder later?**
- Yes, soon → Bolt is fine. They will rebuild it anyway.
- No, this is the system you will run on for 2+ years → Developer from day 1. The Bolt foundation is technical debt you will pay for.

Most founders who run this checklist honestly land on "Bolt for week 1 to 4, then hand to a developer". The mistake is staying on Bolt past month 2, when the token bill and the bug-fight time cross over the cost of the developer. The second mistake is hiring a developer before there is anything to harden — you pay for a 6-week sprint to ship an idea that did not need that level of rigor yet.

If you are unsure which side you are on, the [6-Week MVP Sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp) page has a free 30-minute scoping call. We will tell you to keep using Bolt if that is the right answer. We will tell you to hire someone else if our slot is not the right fit. The wrong answer is to keep paying $200 a month for a tool that is no longer compounding.`,

    {
      heading: 'Ship the MVP the Right Way — Bolt to Developer Handoff',
      content: `If you are reading this and your Bolt app is already breaking, the move is the same as for [Lovable rescue](/en/notes/lovable-alternative-developer-when-ai-builder-breaks): export the code, hire a senior developer for 2 weeks, fix the critical path, decide whether to stabilize or rebuild. The cost is $5K to $8K. The alternative is paying $200 a month forever and watching your conversion rate drop.

If you have not started yet and you know the project is real — paying users, regulated data, complex auth, real revenue — skip Bolt. Start with the [6-Week MVP Sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp) at $15K to $30K, ship a production-ready Next.js + Postgres app with tests and CI, and you will not need a rescue contract three months from now. The first build done right is cheaper than the second build done after the first one broke.

If you want a senior India-based developer on retainer instead of a one-shot sprint, the [hire-founding-engineer-india](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) service is a $5K–$10K monthly retainer for 80 to 160 hours. Same person, full system context, no equity dilution, and the cost over a year is less than one US senior developer's quarterly base salary.

The honest summary: in 2026, Bolt.new and a developer are not competitors. They are sequential tools for different stages of the same product. Bolt for week 1 to 4 of validation. Developer for everything after. Founders who treat them as either-or pay the cost twice.`,
