Ship SpeechAnalyzer for English/major-locale Apple apps. Stay on **Whisper/WhisperKit** if you need 100+ languages or custom vocabulary, and reach for **Parakeet** on disfluent real-world speech.

Apple did a strange thing with SpeechAnalyzer. They replaced the decade-old \`SFSpeechRecognizer\`, shipped a genuinely modern on-device transcription stack in **iOS 26 and macOS 26**, demoed it at [WWDC25](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/277/), and then published **not a single word error rate**. The API landed with marketing adjectives — "fast", "on-device", "long-form" — and zero measured accuracy.

For anyone deciding what to put in a voice-notes app, a meeting recorder, or a dictation feature, that silence is the whole problem. "Better than the old one" is not a number you can design around. So this week an independent benchmark ran SpeechAnalyzer against the model everyone actually compares to — **OpenAI's Whisper** — on standard [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12) audio, and the results made the Hacker News front page.

The short version: Apple's silence was hiding a win. **SpeechAnalyzer scored 2.12% WER on clean speech** — [per the get-inscribe benchmark](https://get-inscribe.com/blog/apple-speech-api-benchmark.html) — better than every on-device Whisper variant tested, at roughly triple the speed of Whisper Small. But "best on-device English accuracy" is not the same as "the one you should ship", and the gap between those two claims is where this post lives: the real numbers, the Swift to wire it up, the [diarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_diarisation) hole every writeup ignores, and the two production cases where I'd still pick Whisper.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'What did the benchmark actually measure?',
            content: `Word error rate on [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12) — the standard read-English corpus — split into \`test-clean\` (clean audio) and \`test-other\` (noisier, harder). Lower is better. From the [July 2026 benchmark](https://get-inscribe.com/blog/apple-speech-api-benchmark.html), every engine running **fully on-device** on an M2 Pro:

| Engine | test-clean WER | test-other WER |
|--------|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| **Apple SpeechAnalyzer** | **2.12%** | **4.56%** |
| Whisper Small | 3.74% | 7.95% |
| Whisper Base | 5.42% | 12.51% |
| Whisper Tiny | 7.88% | 17.04% |
| SFSpeechRecognizer (legacy) | 9.02% | 16.25% |

Two things jump out. First, SpeechAnalyzer beats **every** on-device Whisper size on both splits — not marginally, but by **43% relative** on clean speech versus Whisper Small. Second, the old \`SFSpeechRecognizer\` you may still be shipping is **4.3x worse** (9.02% vs 2.12%). If your app targets iOS 26, that migration is free accuracy.

The one caveat the number needs: Apple's **2.12%** is *just shy of Whisper Large v3's ~2.1%* — but Large v3 typically needs a GPU and is not built for real-time on-device use. On the M2 Pro, SpeechAnalyzer transcribed a 34-minute video in **45 seconds**; Whisper Large V3 Turbo took **101 seconds** for the same clip. So Apple is matching the accuracy of a model class that usually needs a datacenter, at laptop speed, offline. That is the actual story, and it is a very good one.

Where the picture gets more honest is multilingual. A separate [4-engine test on 13,023 samples across five languages](https://dicta.to/blog/speech-to-text-engine-comparison-mac-2026/) found SpeechAnalyzer winning **German (6.7%) and Italian (4.0%)**, but WhisperKit taking **English (5.2%)** and **Spanish (4.5%)** in *their* harder real-world set. English clean-read audio and English messy-real audio are different games.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How do you actually call SpeechAnalyzer from Swift?',
            content: `The new API is three types: **\`SpeechAnalyzer\`** (the session), **\`SpeechTranscriber\`** (the module that turns audio into text), and **\`AssetInventory\`** (downloads the on-device language model). You compose a module into an analyzer, feed it an async stream of audio, and read results off another async sequence — no completion-handler soup. This is the essential shape from [WWDC25 session 277](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/277/):

\`\`\`swift
import Speech

// 1. A transcriber module bound to a locale.
let transcriber = SpeechTranscriber(
    locale: Locale(identifier: "en-US"),
    transcriptionOptions: [],
    reportingOptions: [.volatileResults],   // stream partials as the user speaks
    attributeOptions: [.audioTimeRange]      // word-level timestamps
)

// 2. Make sure the on-device model is installed (first run downloads it).
if let request = try await AssetInventory.assetInstallationRequest(
    supporting: [transcriber]
) {
    try await request.downloadAndInstall()
}

// 3. Wire the module into an analyzer.
let analyzer = SpeechAnalyzer(modules: [transcriber])

// 4. Read results off an async sequence — volatile (live) then finalized.
Task {
    for try await result in transcriber.results {
        let text = result.text                 // AttributedString, carries timings
        print(result.isFinal ? "FINAL: \\(text)" : "…live: \\(text)")
    }
}

// 5. Feed audio buffers as they arrive from AVAudioEngine.
let (stream, input) = AsyncStream<AnalyzerInput>.makeStream()
try await analyzer.start(inputSequence: stream)
// input.yield(AnalyzerInput(buffer: pcmBuffer))  // in your tap callback
\`\`\`

Three things worth noting for production. The **\`.volatileResults\`** option is what gives you the live, updating caption effect — you get provisional text immediately and a corrected \`isFinal\` version a beat later. The **\`AssetInventory\`** download is a one-time per-locale cost you should trigger *before* the user hits record, not during. And because it is **on-device with no server fallback**, you get no Business Associate Agreement headaches for health or legal apps — the audio never leaves the phone. Compare that to [running a large model locally](/en/notes/inkling-975b-run-locally-vram-guide-2026), where "on-device" means a 600 GB machine; here it means an iPhone.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'Where does SpeechAnalyzer genuinely win?',
            content: `Three concrete workflows where it is now the obvious default:

**1. Long-form dictation and transcription on Apple hardware.** The old \`SFSpeechRecognizer\` had a ~1-minute practical ceiling and degraded on distant mics. SpeechAnalyzer is built for **long-form audio with no duration cap** and [handles far-field audio better](https://www.forasoft.com/blog/article/speech-recognition-with-neural-networks-on-ios-1621). A meeting recorder, a lecture-notes app, a podcast transcriber — this is the target. At **45 seconds for 34 minutes of audio**, a one-hour recording transcribes in under a minute-and-a-half.

**2. Privacy-sensitive verticals.** Because processing is fully on-device with no cloud path, a therapy-notes app, a clinical scribe, or a legal dictation tool can transcribe without a single byte of audio leaving the device. That removes an entire compliance workstream — no data-processing addendum, no BAA, no "where is the audio stored" question in the security review.

**3. Live captions with low latency.** The \`.volatileResults\` stream gives you sub-second provisional text. On an M2 Pro the benchmark measured **12x to 40x real-time**, so live captioning has enormous headroom even on a phone-class chip. For accessibility features and real-time subtitles, that latency budget is the difference between "usable" and "annoying".

The through-line: if your users are on iOS 26 / macOS 26 and speaking a [supported locale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/speechanalyzer), SpeechAnalyzer is faster, more accurate, and cheaper to operate (zero inference cost, zero servers) than anything you were running before. The reasons to look elsewhere are specific, and they are the next section.`,

| | **Apple SpeechAnalyzer** | Whisper (via [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit)) | NVIDIA Parakeet | Qwen3-ASR |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Clean English WER | **2.12%** | 3.74% (Small) | competitive | competitive |
| Best at | clean read speech | messy English, custom vocab | **disfluent real speech** | multilingual |
| Speed (M2 Pro) | **12–40x realtime** | ~1/3 of Apple | fast | moderate |
| Languages | ~30 locales | **100+** | 25 | 30 |
| Platforms | iOS/macOS 26 only | iOS 16+, any Core ML host | cross-platform | cross-platform |
| Custom vocabulary | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Speaker diarization | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cost to run | free (OS API) | free (open weights) | free | free |

Read it by column, not by winner. **Apple** wins clean English accuracy and speed, but is locked to the newest OS and can't learn your product's brand names. **Whisper/WhisperKit** is the portability and vocabulary play — 100+ languages, custom terms, runs anywhere Core ML runs, and [it took English and Spanish](https://dicta.to/blog/speech-to-text-engine-comparison-mac-2026/) in the harder real-world set. **Parakeet** is the one that "wins when people actually talk" — disfluent, um-and-uh speech where clean-corpus scores stop predicting anything. **Qwen3-ASR** is the multilingual generalist at 30 languages.

The uncomfortable truth the single-number headlines miss: **on your users' real audio, the LibriSpeech ranking may not hold.** Clean read English is the easiest possible test. Pick two engines and run them on *your* recordings before you commit.`,

            heading: 'When to skip SpeechAnalyzer (and the gap nobody mentions)',
            content: `Skip it — or pair it — in four cases:

**You need more than ~30 languages.** SpeechTranscriber [supports around 30 locales](https://dicta.to/blog/speech-to-text-engine-comparison-mac-2026/); Whisper covers **100+**. If your user base is genuinely global, Apple's list will strand people. This is the single most common disqualifier.

**You need custom vocabulary.** SpeechAnalyzer has **no custom-vocabulary or biasing API** today. If your domain is full of drug names, ticker symbols, or product SKUs, a raw transcriber will mangle them — the dicta.to test saw jargon WER around **20%** until a proofread layer cut it to **~10%**. WhisperKit and Parakeet let you bias toward a term list; Apple does not.

**You must run on older OSes or non-Apple platforms.** SpeechAnalyzer is **iOS 26 / macOS 26 and later, Apple-only**. Shipping to iOS 17, Android, or a Linux server? WhisperKit (iOS 16+) or server-side Whisper is your floor.

**And the gap every writeup skips: speaker diarization.** None of these engines tell you *who* said each sentence. SpeechAnalyzer, WhisperKit, Parakeet, Qwen3 — [all four transcribe, none diarize](https://www.forasoft.com/blog/article/speech-recognition-with-neural-networks-on-ios-1621). For a solo dictation app that's fine. For a **meeting recorder**, "who said what" is the actual product, and you will need a separate diarization stage ([pyannote](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio), WhisperX, or a cloud API) layered on top. I have watched a "just use Apple's new API" plan quietly discover this three weeks in, after the demo worked and the real feature didn't. Budget for it up front.`,

        {
            heading: 'How I would ship this in production',
            content: `If I were building a voice feature on Apple platforms this quarter, here is the exact wiring — because the model is the easy 20%, and the plumbing around it is the part that ships late.

**Default to SpeechAnalyzer, gate it on OS + locale.** Detect iOS 26 / macOS 26 and a supported locale at runtime; when both hold, use it — best accuracy, best speed, zero server cost, no compliance surface. Trigger the \`AssetInventory\` model download during onboarding, not at first record, so the user never waits on a cold model.

**Keep WhisperKit as the fallback lane, not the main road.** Older OS, unsupported language, or a user who needs custom vocabulary → route to [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) with a biased term list. One transcription \`protocol\`, two implementations behind it, chosen by capability check. This is a half-day of abstraction that saves you a rewrite when Android shows up on the roadmap.

**Treat diarization as a first-class stage, not a footnote.** If the product is "who said what", the pipeline is *transcribe → diarize → align → label*, and the transcriber is one of four boxes. Prototype the diarization step in week one, on real multi-speaker audio, before you promise the feature — it is the piece most likely to be worse than the demo suggested.

**Instrument WER on your own audio.** LibriSpeech is not your users. Log a sample of transcripts (with consent), hand-correct a small held-out set, and measure real WER per engine per locale. The [benchmark that made this post](https://get-inscribe.com/blog/apple-speech-api-benchmark.html) exists precisely because vendors don't publish the number that matters — yours; do the same internally.

That fallback routing, the capability gate, the diarization stage, the consent-gated measurement loop — that scaffolding is most of the real work in a voice feature, and it is what teams skip and then retrofit after a bad review. It's what I build: [6-week MVPs](/en/services/6-week-mvp) that ship with the fallback path and the measurement already wired, or a [founding engineer](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) embedded with your team to get the on-device speech stack right the first time. If you're choosing an STT engine for a product right now, that's a conversation worth having before you hard-code one API into every screen.`,
