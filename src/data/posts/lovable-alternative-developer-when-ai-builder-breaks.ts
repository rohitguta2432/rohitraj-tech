If your Lovable app is already broken in production, the right alternative is not another AI builder — it is a human developer who can read your exported code in 48 hours and tell you whether to fix it or rebuild. Every "10 best Lovable alternatives" blog post is written for founders shopping *before* they commit. If you are past that point and you have 200 paying users on an app that fell over last Tuesday, switching to Bolt will not save you.

I get a version of this message once a week: "Built an MVP on Lovable, hit 500 users, Stripe webhook is firing twice, auth breaks on iOS Safari, can you help?" The answer every vendor wants you to hear is "migrate to our platform." The answer you actually need is "export your code, hire a developer for 2 weeks, fix it, then decide if you want to keep the stack or rebuild." That is the honest alternative nobody in the vibe coding space is selling.

Lovable is a good tool. I recommend it to pre-product founders every week. But the moment you have users, money flowing, or regulated data, the conversation changes. The question is no longer "which AI builder ships fastest?" It is "who owns this codebase when it breaks at 3am?" If you cannot answer that, your alternative is not another tool — it is a person.`

      heading: 'When Lovable (and Bolt, and v0) Actually Breaks',
      content: `Lovable breaks predictably at three thresholds: 500 concurrent users, any custom auth flow beyond email/password, and any payment logic more complex than Stripe Checkout. Bolt breaks at similar points. v0 was never meant to ship production apps. Replit handles scale better but has its own edge cases. Every AI builder has the same underlying limit — they are optimized for the first 80% of a product, not the last 20% that keeps users.

Here is where I see founders get stuck in 2026, ranked by frequency:

| Failure mode | How it shows up | What fixes it |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Auth breaks on mobile Safari | Login loops, silent session loss | Custom cookie config, Supabase SSR fix |
| Stripe webhooks double-fire | Duplicate charges, angry support tickets | Idempotency keys, webhook signature validation |
| Postgres queries slow at 10K rows | App freezes under load | Indexes, query rewrites, connection pooling |
| Row-level security broken | User A sees User B's data | RLS policy audit, migration |
| Deployment pipeline fails randomly | "It worked yesterday" | CI/CD cleanup, env var audit |
| Email deliverability tanks | Signups stop converting | SPF/DKIM/DMARC setup, sender reputation fix |
| TypeScript errors in exported code | Cannot deploy after edits | Type refactor, clean up any-types |
| Mobile push notifications never fire | Users never come back | Native bridge setup, FCM/APNS config |

None of these are solved by switching AI builders. They are solved by someone reading the code, understanding the bug, and writing a targeted fix. AI builders generate code; they do not debug the code they generated six weeks ago on an older model version.

The reason founders keep hearing "migrate to X" is that every platform runs a partner program that pays for referrals. The reason you keep hearing "hire a developer" from me is that I do not run one.`

      heading: 'What a Lovable Rescue Contract Actually Costs in 2026',
      content: `A Lovable rescue contract runs $2,500–$8,000 for 2–4 weeks of work, depending on which of the failure modes above you have hit. Compare that to rebuilding from scratch on a different tool — which, for a working MVP with real users, typically costs $15K–$30K and 6–10 weeks. Rescue is almost always the correct move if your app has paying users.

Here is the typical rescue engagement, priced by scope:

| Scope | Timeline | Cost range | What you get |
|-------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Audit only | 3–5 days | $750–$1,500 | Written doc: what is broken, what to fix first, what is technical debt |
| Critical bug fixes | 1–2 weeks | $2,500–$5,000 | Auth, payments, RLS, data loss bugs — the stuff losing you money |
| Stabilization sprint | 3–4 weeks | $6,000–$12,000 | Critical fixes + monitoring, CI/CD, basic performance, 30-day support |
| Full rebuild | 6–10 weeks | $15,000–$30,000 | Ground-up Next.js + Postgres rewrite with the learnings from v1 |

The right call depends on two questions: how much revenue does the app generate, and how different is v2 going to be from v1? If you are making $5K MRR and the product is basically right, stabilize. If you are pre-revenue and you have learned a lot from the Lovable MVP, rebuild. The worst move is paying for a stabilization sprint on an app you are going to throw away in 90 days.

Most founders I talk to pick stabilization, realize they want 3 new features that do not fit the Lovable architecture, and then rebuild 4 months later. If you know that is your path, skip the stabilization and go straight to rebuild. You save $6K–$12K.`

      heading: 'How to Actually Find a Developer Who Can Read Lovable Output',
      content: `The developer you want has shipped at least 5 production apps, knows the modern React + Supabase + Stripe stack cold, and can audit a codebase in 2–3 hours and tell you exactly what is wrong. They are not on Upwork. They are not on Fiverr. They are on their own portfolio site, on X, or in one specific Discord server you have probably never heard of.

A working filter checklist when you interview:

- Ask them to screen-share and audit your actual repo on the call (real developers will; consultants will not)
- Ask "what is wrong with this code?" and look for specifics within 90 seconds
- Ask for 2 references from founders who had Lovable/Bolt apps rescued — not just "past clients"
- Look for a portfolio page with live shipped products, not just GitHub links
- Check whether they have written technical blog posts — if they cannot explain their thinking in writing, they will struggle to hand the codebase back to you

Red flags:

- "I will need 2 weeks just to assess" (real devs can audit in days)
- Refuses to work on a 2-week fixed-scope trial
- Wants to rewrite before looking at what exists
- Cannot name the specific Lovable export format off the top of their head
- Charges less than $1,500 for an audit (they are either new or they will disappear)

The rescue market is small because most senior devs do not want this work — it is messy, the code is often bad, and the founder is stressed. The ones who do this work intentionally do it well, and they do not advertise on Upwork because they do not need to.

If you want to see what a rescue timeline and deliverable actually looks like, I have one linked at the bottom of this page. It is not a sales page. It is a written scope document, with real cost, real timelines, and a list of the failure modes I fix most often.

The pattern I run for founders in this situation is either a [founding engineer in India](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) or a [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp) — pick based on whether you need shipped code or shipped *and* maintained code.

      heading: 'When You Should Just Keep Using Lovable',
      content: `Keep using Lovable if you have fewer than 200 users, you are pre-revenue, and you are still validating the product idea. Migration and rescue are expensive. Most founders who ask about alternatives are not actually stuck — they are frustrated. Frustration with a tool is not the same as a broken product.

A quick self-check before you pay anyone:

- **Under 200 users, no revenue, no complaints:** keep shipping on Lovable. You have not hit the wall yet.
- **200–500 users, < $1K MRR, occasional bugs:** stabilize with a 1-week contractor engagement (~$3K), keep the stack.
- **500+ users, $1K+ MRR, recurring bugs:** full rescue or rebuild. The cost of downtime is now higher than the cost of a developer.
- **Regulated data (HIPAA, PCI, GDPR data residency):** rescue today. Your compliance exposure compounds.
- **Custom auth, SSO, SAML required:** rebuild. Lovable cannot do this cleanly and never will.
- **Mobile push notifications required:** rebuild on React Native. Lovable is web-only by design.

Most founders switch tools too early. The cost of migration is almost always higher than the cost of stabilizing what you have. The exception is when your product has fundamentally outgrown the stack — and if that is you, you already know.

The best Lovable alternative in 2026 is the one the vibe coding industry will never recommend: keep Lovable until it breaks in a way that costs you money, then hire a human to fix it. That is the unglamorous answer, and it is almost always the correct one.`
