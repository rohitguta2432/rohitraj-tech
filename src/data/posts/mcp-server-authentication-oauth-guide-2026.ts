For most of the last two years, "auth on an MCP server" meant one of two things: nothing at all, or a hardcoded API key in a header. That was fine when every MCP server ran locally over STDIO and the only client was your own desktop. It stopped being fine the moment MCP servers went remote and multi-tenant — the moment a server at \`https://mcp.yourcompany.com\` started accepting connections from clients you do not control, acting on data you are legally responsible for.

The Model Context Protocol's answer is a real, standards-based authorization model layered on **OAuth 2.1**, and as of this week it got a major upgrade: **Enterprise-Managed Authorization** reached stable status on [June 18, 2026](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/enterprise-managed-auth/). The headline is "zero-touch OAuth" — an enterprise can wire up a server once and every employee gets access at login, no consent-screen tango per server.

This is the builder's read, not a spec recap. Below: what the authorization spec actually requires of your server (and the one classification mistake that breaks everything), the full OAuth 2.1 flow with copy-paste code, why **Dynamic Client Registration is now deprecated** and what replaced it, how the new ID-JAG enterprise grant works, a 3-way comparison table the other guides do not have, when you should skip OAuth entirely, and the production wiring — token-audience binding, the confused-deputy attack — that decides whether your server is secure or a liability.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'Why does a remote MCP server need real auth — and what does the spec mandate?',
            content: `Start with the role, because getting it wrong is the most common failure I see. Under the [MCP authorization spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization), **a protected MCP server acts as an OAuth 2.1 _resource server_** — it accepts and validates access tokens but does not issue them. The MCP client is the OAuth client, and a separate **authorization server** (which may be hosted with your server or be an entirely separate entity like Okta, Auth0, or WorkOS) is what actually talks to the user and mints tokens. If you find yourself writing login UI inside your MCP server, you have conflated the resource server with the authorization server, and you are about to reinvent OAuth badly.

Authorization in MCP is technically **OPTIONAL**, but the spec is opinionated about transports: HTTP-based servers **SHOULD** conform to the OAuth spec, while **STDIO servers SHOULD NOT** — they retrieve credentials from the environment instead. So the rule of thumb is simple: local STDIO server, use env vars; remote HTTP server, use OAuth 2.1.

The "selected subset" of OAuth the spec pins down is worth knowing by RFC, because these are the exact pieces you must implement:

- **OAuth 2.1** ([draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13)) — the baseline. PKCE is mandatory; the implicit grant is prohibited.
- **Protected Resource Metadata — [RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)** — your server **MUST** implement this. It is how a client discovers which authorization server to use.
- **Authorization Server Metadata — [RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414)** (or OpenID Connect Discovery) — at least one must be supported.
- **Resource Indicators — [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)** — the \`resource\` parameter that binds a token to your server specifically. This is the anti-confused-deputy control, and it is a **MUST**.
- **Issuer Identification — [RFC 9207](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207)** — the \`iss\` check that defends against mix-up attacks.

Three things are non-negotiable for a compliant server: publish Protected Resource Metadata, validate that tokens were issued for your audience, and reject anything else. Everything in the next section is the choreography around those three.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How does the MCP OAuth 2.1 flow work, step by step?',
            content: `The whole dance kicks off with a 401. When a client hits your server without a token, you reject it and tell it where to look:

\`\`\`http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource",
                         scope="files:read"
\`\`\`

That \`resource_metadata\` URL points at your **Protected Resource Metadata** document — the [RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728) file every MCP server must serve. It is small and declarative:

\`\`\`json
{
  "resource": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
  "authorization_servers": ["https://auth.example.com"],
  "scopes_supported": ["files:read", "files:write"],
  "bearer_methods_supported": ["header"]
}
\`\`\`

From there the client: (1) reads your metadata and learns which authorization server to talk to; (2) fetches **that** server's metadata via \`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server\` or OpenID Connect Discovery; (3) registers as a client; (4) generates PKCE parameters and includes the \`resource\` parameter naming your server; (5) sends the user through the browser authorization request; (6) **validates the \`iss\` value** in the redirect against the issuer it recorded (RFC 9207, defeating mix-up attacks); (7) exchanges the authorization code plus the PKCE \`code_verifier\` for an access token; and (8) finally calls your server with \`Authorization: Bearer <token>\` on **every** request. Tokens must never ride in the query string.

Your half of this is the cheap half: serve the metadata, then validate the token on every call. A minimal validator in TypeScript using \`jose\`:

\`\`\`ts
import { createRemoteJWKSet, jwtVerify } from "jose";

const JWKS = createRemoteJWKSet(
  new URL("https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json")
);

export async function verifyMcpToken(authHeader: string) {
  const token = authHeader.replace(/^Bearer /, "");
  const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
    issuer: "https://auth.example.com",
    // RFC 8707: the token MUST have been issued for THIS server.
    audience: "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
  });
  return payload; // contains scopes; enforce least privilege from here
}
\`\`\`

The line that matters most is \`audience\`. The spec is blunt: MCP servers **MUST** validate that access tokens were issued specifically for them, and **MUST NOT** accept or transit any other tokens. Skip that check and any token your server can read becomes a key to your server — the textbook confused-deputy hole. If a client lacks a scope at runtime, you return a **403** with an \`insufficient_scope\` challenge (not a 401), and the client runs a step-up flow to request the missing scope. Malformed requests get a **400**.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'Dynamic Client Registration is out; Client ID Metadata Documents are in',
            content: `Here is the detail that almost every MCP OAuth tutorial published before mid-2026 gets wrong, including the ones currently ranking for this query. They tell you to implement **Dynamic Client Registration** ([RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)) — the \`POST /register\` endpoint where an unknown client self-registers and gets credentials. That was the original answer to "how does a client an MCP server has never seen get a client_id?"

As of the current spec, **DCR is deprecated.** It is retained only for backwards compatibility with authorization servers that do not support its replacement: **Client ID Metadata Documents** ([draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00)). Instead of POSTing to a registration endpoint, the client simply uses an **HTTPS URL as its \`client_id\`**; the authorization server detects the URL form, fetches the client's metadata document from that URL, and validates the redirect URIs. No registration round-trip, no pile of ephemeral client records to garbage-collect.

The spec now defines three registration mechanisms in priority order — **Client ID Metadata Documents, pre-registration, or DCR** — and authorization servers and clients **SHOULD** support the metadata-document approach. If you are building a new server in 2026, design for Client ID Metadata Documents first and treat DCR as the legacy fallback, not the default. This single change quietly removes one of the gnarliest pieces of remote MCP auth (managing dynamically registered clients) and it is the kind of moving-target detail that makes "I read one blog and shipped it" risky for anything touching auth.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'Enterprise-Managed Authorization: zero-touch OAuth with ID-JAG (the June 2026 shipment)',
            content: `Everything above is the per-user OAuth flow, and it has one obvious enterprise problem: a developer who connects to twelve internal MCP servers has to click through twelve consent screens, and an admin has no central place to grant or revoke that access. **Enterprise-Managed Authorization (EMA)** — which reached stable status on [June 18, 2026](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/enterprise-managed-auth/) — is the fix, and it is the single biggest reason to revisit your MCP auth this quarter.

EMA shifts authorization from the individual to the organization. Instead of each employee manually authorizing each server, an administrator defines access policy **once** in the company identity provider, keyed on group membership, roles, and conditional-access rules. The user signs in once; the IdP decides which servers they can reach; the consent screens disappear. Hence "zero-touch."

The mechanism is the **Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant (ID-JAG)**, an IETF draft grant type. The flow is short: during SSO the client obtains an **ID-JAG token** from the IdP, then exchanges that token for an access token from the MCP server's authorization server, bypassing the per-server consent step entirely. It builds on the groundwork tracked as **SEP-990**, and the extension itself lives in the [modelcontextprotocol/ext-auth](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-auth) repository — important, because MCP authorization extensions are explicitly **optional, additive, composable, and independently versioned**. EMA does not replace core OAuth 2.1; it layers on top of it.

This is not a paper standard. The launch shipped with real adopters: **Okta** (via its Cross App Access / XAA capability) on the IdP side, **Anthropic's Claude** and **Visual Studio Code** as clients, and **Asana, Atlassian, Canva, Figma, Linear, and Supabase** as servers, with more (including Slack) adding support. If you sell an MCP server into companies, EMA is fast becoming the table-stakes way they will expect to roll it out — and "we support enterprise-managed auth" is a real procurement checkbox now, not a nice-to-have.`,

        {
            heading: 'API key vs OAuth 2.1 vs Enterprise-Managed Auth: which to pick',
            content: `The three approaches are not competitors so much as a ladder you climb as your server's blast radius grows. Here is the honest comparison — the table none of the top-ranking guides include:

| | **Bearer / API key** | **OAuth 2.1 (per-user)** | **Enterprise-Managed Auth (ID-JAG)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Best for | STDIO, internal tools, service-to-service | Public remote servers, unknown clients | Org-wide rollout across many servers |
| Who grants access | You, manually | The end user, per server | An admin, once, in the IdP |
| Per-server consent screen | None | Yes, every server | None (zero-touch) |
| Spec status | Allowed for internal use | Required for public remote servers | Stable extension (June 18, 2026) |
| Token audience binding | Manual | MUST validate (RFC 8707) | MUST validate (RFC 8707) |
| Client registration | N/A | Client ID Metadata Docs (DCR deprecated) | Via IdP / Cross App Access |
| Revocation | Rotate the key | Revoke the token/grant | Central IdP policy |
| Setup effort | Minutes | A few days | IdP + extension wiring |
| Failure mode if done wrong | Leaked static key | Confused deputy, token passthrough | IdP misconfig = over-broad access |

The progression is the point. A purely internal server where the only caller is another one of your services does **not** need OAuth — a well-managed bearer token is simpler and equally safe. The moment unknown clients connect, OAuth 2.1 is mandatory. And the moment you are selling into companies that run dozens of servers, EMA is what makes adoption painless. Pick the lowest rung that covers your actual threat model; do not cargo-cult full OAuth onto a localhost tool.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'When should you skip full OAuth on an MCP server?',
            content: `The implementation guides rarely say this out loud, so I will: **most MCP servers do not need the full OAuth 2.1 flow today, and bolting it on anyway is a common waste.**

Skip OAuth and use environment credentials when your server is **STDIO-only** — the spec literally tells you to. A server that runs as a local subprocess of one trusted client has no untrusted network surface; an API key from the environment is the right tool, and the spec's own guidance is that STDIO servers SHOULD NOT follow the OAuth flow.

Skip it for **internal service-to-service** servers where the client is another one of your own backends. A pre-shared bearer token, rotated and stored in a secrets manager, is simpler than standing up authorization-server discovery and equally secure when the key is managed properly. OAuth's value is delegated, user-mediated access to a server reached by clients you do not control — if that is not your situation, you are paying complexity for a guarantee you do not need.

And be cautious about adopting **Enterprise-Managed Authorization before you have an enterprise to manage.** ID-JAG is genuinely useful, but it presumes a corporate IdP, defined access groups, and admins who will configure policy. For a solo or early-stage server, that machinery is overhead with no payoff yet — ship per-user OAuth 2.1 and graduate to EMA when a customer's security team asks for it. The discipline is the same one I bring to any [AI integration build](/en/services/ai-chatbot-development): match the auth to the actual blast radius, not to the most impressive diagram.`,

            heading: 'How I would ship MCP auth in production',
            content: `I have built [MCP servers from scratch](/en/notes/spring-boot-mcp) and shipped AI features that act on real user accounts, and the part that keeps me up is never the happy-path flow — it is the failure modes the README skips. Here is how I would actually wire production MCP auth.

**Bind every token to your server, and prove it on every call.** The single most important line of code is the audience check. RFC 8707's \`resource\` parameter and the spec's "MUST validate the token was issued for them" rule exist because of the **confused-deputy attack**: a token your server accepts but that was minted for a *different* resource lets an attacker borrow your server's privileges. Validate \`aud\`, validate \`iss\`, and **never** forward a received token to a downstream API — that token-passthrough anti-pattern is how one compromised server becomes a pivot point. If your server needs to call something else, it gets its own token for that resource.

**Design scopes for least privilege from day one.** Put the required scope in your \`WWW-Authenticate\` challenge so clients request exactly what they need, and split read from write (\`files:read\` vs \`files:write\`) so a summarizer agent can never silently delete. When a request lacks a scope, return a 403 \`insufficient_scope\` challenge and let the client run the step-up flow — do not pre-grant broad scopes "to avoid friction."

**Treat the authorization server as someone else's job.** Do not hand-roll token issuance. Use a real authorization server — Okta, Auth0, WorkOS, Keycloak — and let your MCP server stay a pure resource server that only validates. This is also what makes the jump to Enterprise-Managed Auth cheap later: if your server already trusts a standards-compliant IdP, adding ID-JAG support is an extension, not a rewrite.

**Make auth observable.** Log every 401, 403, and audience-mismatch with the (hashed) client and resource so you can see attacks and misconfigurations. An MCP server that silently accepts a slightly-wrong token is worse than one that loudly rejects a valid one. The integration that does not fall over in month three matters more than the one that demos cleanly in week one — which is the whole reason I ship production AI work the way I do.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'FAQ: MCP server authentication',
            content: `**Does an MCP server require OAuth?** Not always. Authorization is optional in the MCP spec. STDIO servers should read credentials from the environment, and internal service-to-service servers can use managed bearer tokens. But **remote, public HTTP MCP servers should implement OAuth 2.1** — that is the spec's clear guidance for clients you do not control.

**What OAuth version does MCP use?** OAuth 2.1 ([draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13)), with PKCE mandatory and the implicit grant prohibited. Your MCP server acts as an OAuth 2.1 _resource server_, not an authorization server.

**Is Dynamic Client Registration required for MCP?** No — and as of the current spec it is **deprecated**. The preferred mechanism is **Client ID Metadata Documents** (the client uses an HTTPS URL as its \`client_id\`). DCR ([RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)) is retained only for backwards compatibility with older authorization servers.

**What is Enterprise-Managed Authorization (zero-touch OAuth)?** A stable MCP authorization extension (shipped June 18, 2026) that lets an organization's identity provider grant access to all approved MCP servers at single sign-on — no per-server consent. It uses the **ID-JAG** (Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant) and is adopted by Okta, Claude, VS Code, Asana, Atlassian, Canva, Figma, Linear, and Supabase.

**How do I stop my MCP server from being a confused deputy?** Validate that every access token's audience is your server (RFC 8707 \`resource\` parameter), validate the issuer (RFC 9207), reject tokens minted for any other resource, and never forward a received token to a downstream service — mint a fresh token scoped to that downstream instead.`,
