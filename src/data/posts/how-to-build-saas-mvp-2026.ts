To build a SaaS MVP in 2026, focus on 1-3 core features, use a free-tier stack (Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, Stripe), and launch in 6 weeks for $5,000-$8,500. The key approach is ruthless scope discipline — build only what proves people will pay, skip everything else, and iterate based on real user feedback after launch.

An MVP is the smallest thing you can build that proves people will pay for your solution. It's not a prototype, not a landing page, and definitely not your "full vision" with 30 features.

I've seen founders spend 8 months and $50K building something nobody wanted. I've also helped founders launch in 6 weeks for under $8K and get their first 10 paying customers. The difference? Scope discipline.

**Your MVP should have:**
- 1-3 core features that solve the main problem
- Authentication (sign up, log in, forgot password)
- A payment flow (Stripe or Razorpay)
- Basic admin dashboard
- That's it.

**Your MVP should NOT have:**
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics
- Mobile app (unless mobile IS the product)
- Multi-language support
- Custom domain for each customer
- AI features "because investors like AI"`

      heading: 'What Tech Stack Should You Use for a SaaS MVP in 2026?',
      content: `After building multiple SaaS products, here's the stack I recommend for speed and cost:

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS | SSR, great DX, huge ecosystem |
| Backend | Next.js API Routes or Spring Boot | Depends on complexity (see below) |
| Database | PostgreSQL (via Supabase) | Free tier, auth built-in, real-time |
| Auth | Supabase Auth or Clerk | Don't build auth yourself |
| Payments | Stripe (global) / Razorpay (India) | Handles subscriptions, invoices |
| Hosting | Vercel or AWS Amplify | Free tier, auto-deploy from Git |
| Email | Resend or AWS SES | Transactional emails |
| File storage | Supabase Storage or S3 | Cheap, reliable |

**Use Next.js API routes** if your backend is simple CRUD — user management, basic data operations, webhooks. This is 80% of SaaS MVPs.

**Use Spring Boot** if you have complex business logic, background processing, or need enterprise-grade security. ClinIQ AI needed this because of healthcare data requirements.

**Total monthly cost for an MVP serving 0-1000 users: $0-$25.** Supabase free tier gives you 500MB database + auth. Vercel free tier handles the hosting. You only start paying when you have real users — which is exactly when you should.

**Practical tips for choosing your stack:** Avoid the temptation to pick technologies based on what large companies use. Netflix runs on microservices because they serve 200 million users — your MVP will serve 200. Stick with a monolithic architecture until you have clear evidence that a single server cannot handle your load. Also, choose technologies your developer knows best. A React expert shipping in 4 weeks beats a developer learning Svelte and shipping in 8 weeks. The best tech stack for your MVP is the one that gets you to launch fastest.`

      heading: 'Timeline and Cost Breakdown',
      content: `Here's what a realistic MVP timeline looks like with a solo developer:

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
- Project setup, auth, database schema
- Basic UI layout and navigation
- Cost: $1,500-2,500

**Week 3-4: Core Features**
- The 1-3 features that make your product unique
- API integration, business logic
- Cost: $2,000-3,500

**Week 5-6: Polish and Launch**
- Payment integration
- Email notifications
- Error handling, loading states, edge cases
- Deploy to production
- Cost: $1,500-2,500

**Total: 6 weeks, $5,000-8,500**

If someone quotes you $30K+ for an MVP, they're either overbuilding or overcharging. If someone quotes you $1,500, they're going to deliver something that breaks in production.

I typically build MVPs for $5K-$10K depending on complexity. That includes architecture decisions, clean code, deployment, and 30 days of post-launch bug fixes.`

      heading: 'What Are the Biggest Mistakes That Kill SaaS MVPs?',
      content: `**1. Building before validating.** Talk to 20 potential customers before writing a line of code. If you can't find 20 people who say "I'd pay for that," you don't have a business.

**2. Choosing tech based on hype.** Don't use Kubernetes, microservices, or a fancy new framework for your MVP. Use boring, proven technology. You can always migrate later — if you're lucky enough to have that problem.

**3. No payment integration from day one.** If you launch without a way to charge, you'll never add it. The mental barrier gets higher every day. Integrate Stripe in week 5, not "after we get traction."

**4. Building features instead of talking to users.** After launch, your job is customer development, not feature development. Every feature request should come from a paying customer, not your imagination.

**5. Solo founder doing everything.** If you're a technical founder, hire a freelancer for design. If you're a non-technical founder, hire a developer (hi). Don't try to learn React while also validating a business — you'll do both poorly.

**Bonus mistakes I see constantly:** Spending two weeks choosing between Stripe and Paddle instead of just picking one and moving on. Obsessing over the perfect database schema before you have a single user. Building a CI/CD pipeline with staging environments for an app nobody is using yet. Writing comprehensive documentation for code that might get thrown away in a month. Every hour you spend on infrastructure polish is an hour you are not spending on finding customers. Ship first, optimize later.`

      heading: 'How I Work With SaaS Founders',
      content: `I've built MVPs for healthcare (ClinIQ AI), finance (myFinancial), and travel (MicroItinerary). My process:

1. **Free 30-minute scoping call** — We define the MVP scope and I tell you if I'm the right fit
2. **Architecture document** — I write up the tech stack, database schema, and feature list before we start
3. **Weekly demos** — Every Friday you see working software, not just "progress updates"
4. **Milestone payments** — You pay in 3 installments tied to deliverables
5. **30 days free support** — After launch, I fix bugs and handle deployment issues at no extra cost

The goal isn't to build you the perfect product. It's to build you the smallest thing that can start making money, so you can fund the next iteration with revenue instead of savings.

      heading: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
      content: `**Q: How long does it take to build a SaaS MVP?**

A focused SaaS MVP takes 4-6 weeks with a single experienced developer. Week 1-2 covers project setup, authentication, and database schema. Week 3-4 focuses on your core features and business logic. Week 5-6 handles payment integration, polish, and deployment. If your MVP is taking longer than 8 weeks, you are likely building too many features. Cut scope aggressively and launch with less — you can always add features after you have paying customers validating your assumptions.

**Q: How much does it cost to build a SaaS MVP in 2026?**

A SaaS MVP typically costs $5,000-$8,500 with a freelance developer, or $15,000-$40,000 with an agency. The infrastructure cost is nearly zero thanks to generous free tiers from Supabase, Vercel, and Stripe. Your first 1,000 users can run on $0-$25 per month in hosting costs. The biggest cost variable is feature scope — every additional feature adds $1,000-$2,500 to the development budget, which is why ruthless scope discipline matters so much.

**Q: Should I use no-code tools to build my SaaS MVP?**

No-code tools like Bubble or Webflow work for very simple products — landing pages, basic CRUD apps, or internal tools. But they hit limitations quickly with custom business logic, third-party integrations, and performance at scale. If your SaaS requires payment subscriptions, role-based access, or any custom logic beyond basic forms, you will outgrow no-code within 3-6 months and face an expensive rewrite. My recommendation: use no-code for validation (landing page with waitlist) and code for the actual MVP.

**Q: Do I need a mobile app for my SaaS MVP?**

Almost never. A responsive web application works on all devices including phones and tablets. Building a native mobile app doubles your development time and cost. The only exception is if mobile IS your product — for example, a field service app that needs camera access, GPS, or offline functionality. For 90% of SaaS products, a web app launched in 6 weeks beats a mobile app launched in 12 weeks.

**Q: What is the most important feature for a SaaS MVP?**

Payment integration. If your MVP cannot accept money from day one, you are building a hobby project, not a business. The second most important is authentication — users need accounts to use your product repeatedly. Everything else is negotiable. Your one core feature that solves the main problem, plus auth and payments, is a launchable MVP. Analytics, team features, and integrations belong in v2.`
