Every "best OCR API" comparison currently ranking on Google was written before yesterday. [Mistral shipped OCR 4 on June 23, 2026](https://mistral.ai/news/ocr-4/), and the pages that rank for *document OCR comparison* either benchmark only AWS Textract and Google Document AI ([braincuber's 1,000-doc test](https://www.braincuber.com/blog/aws-textract-vs-google-document-ai-ocr-comparison)) or still cite Mistral **OCR 3** numbers. That gap is the whole reason this post exists: if you are choosing an OCR engine this week, you are choosing with stale data.

OCR is the unglamorous bottleneck under almost every document-AI product. Before a model can answer "what's the invoice total" or a RAG pipeline can chunk a 200-page contract, something has to turn pixels into clean, structured text. Get that layer wrong and everything downstream inherits the errors — hallucinated line items, mis-chunked tables, garbled multilingual text. So the OCR decision is not a detail; it sets the accuracy ceiling for the whole system.

Below is the builder's read, not a launch recap: what actually changed in OCR 4 versus OCR 3, the API call (including the new confidence-score gating that no other comparison shows you), an honest accuracy-and-price table against Textract, Google Document AI, and Azure, where each engine genuinely wins, when Mistral is the *wrong* pick, and exactly how I'd wire it into a production RAG ingestion pipeline without it becoming a liability.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'What is actually new in Mistral OCR 4?',
            content: `The headline change is that OCR 4 stops being a text-and-tables extractor and becomes a *layout-aware* one. Where [Mistral OCR 3](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr-3/) mainly returned clean text and markdown tables, **OCR 4 returns bounding boxes, typed-block classification, and inline confidence scores** for every element on the page ([release notes](https://mistral.ai/news/ocr-4/)). "Typed-block classification" means each region comes back labelled — title, table, equation, signature, and so on — instead of an undifferentiated text blob.

The benchmark numbers are the second story. OCR 4 posts **85.20 on OlmOCRBench** (the top score among the models Mistral tested), **93.07 on OmniDocBench**, and a **0.98 score on a multilingual crawl evaluation across eight language groups** ([MarkTechPost write-up, 2026-06-23](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/06/23/mistral-ocr-4/)). In Mistral's own blind human-preference test, annotators preferred OCR 4 output with a **72% average win rate** across the competitors tested. Treat vendor-run blind tests with the usual skepticism — but the public OlmOCRBench and OmniDocBench numbers are independently reproducible.

Coverage widened too: **170 languages across 10 language groups**, plus support for PDF, DOC, PPT, and OpenDocument inputs. And there's a real architectural change for enterprises — OCR 4 ships as **a compact model deployable in a single container**, so teams with data-sovereignty rules can self-host and keep document data on their own infrastructure ([CryptoBriefing, 2026-06-23](https://cryptobriefing.com/mistral-ocr-4-launch/)). That single-container, self-hostable story is the one thing neither Textract nor Document AI can match — both are cloud-only.

One honest caveat the cheerleader posts skip: **the price went up**. OCR 3 was $2 per 1,000 pages; OCR 4 standard API is **$4 per 1,000 pages**. You're paying double OCR 3's rate for the bounding boxes and confidence scores. It's still an order of magnitude cheaper than Textract's forms pricing, but if you only need plain text, OCR 3 (or batch mode) is the cheaper line item.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How do you call the Mistral OCR 4 API?',
            content: `This is the part every ranking comparison omits — none of them show a single line of code. Here's the smallest useful call against \`mistral-ocr-latest\`, using the new confidence scores to gate low-quality extractions before they poison your pipeline:

\`\`\`python
import os
from mistralai import Mistral

client = Mistral(api_key=os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"])

resp = client.ocr.process(
    model="mistral-ocr-latest",
    document={
        "type": "document_url",
        "document_url": "https://example.com/invoice.pdf",
    },
    include_image_base64=False,
)

for page in resp.pages:
    # page.markdown is RAG-ready: clean headings, tables, lists
    chunks = chunk_for_rag(page.markdown)

    # OCR 4 adds typed blocks + confidence — gate before indexing
    for block in page.blocks:
        if block.confidence < 0.70:
            send_to_human_review(block)   # don't silently index garbage
\`\`\`

The unlock here is \`block.confidence\`. In OCR 3 (and in Textract's basic path) you got text with no signal about *how sure the model was*, so a smudged scan and a crisp PDF looked identical downstream. With OCR 4 you can route anything under a threshold to human review and only index what cleared it — which is the difference between a RAG system that quietly answers from corrupted text and one that flags its own blind spots. The full request/response shape lives in the [OCR endpoint docs](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/endpoint/ocr) and the [document-processing guide](https://docs.mistral.ai/studio-api/document-processing/basic_ocr). If you'd rather not write code, the same engine is exposed no-code through Document AI in Mistral Studio. For teams already building agent tooling, this slots in cleanly alongside an [MCP server](/en/notes/mcp-server-authentication-oauth-guide-2026) as a document-ingestion tool.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'Is Mistral OCR 4 more accurate than Textract and Document AI?',
            content: `Short answer: on general document and multilingual extraction, yes; on a few specialized document classes, no. Accuracy depends heavily on document type, and anyone who gives you one number is selling something.

On **complex tables and forms**, independent benchmarks have shown Mistral's engine hitting **96.6% on tables versus Textract's 84.8%** ([AI:PRODUCTIVITY cost comparison](https://aiproductivity.ai/blog/document-ai-cost-comparison/)). On **multilingual** documents Mistral is the standout — the 0.98 crawl score and 170-language support beat Textract's narrower set, and OCR 4's confidence scoring handles skew, low DPI, and compression artifacts gracefully. **Google Document AI** remains the king of *degraded* scans: its Gemini-powered processors recover text from poor-quality sources that break other engines, hit **92% extraction accuracy** on structured fields, and cover **200+ languages** ([businesswaretech invoice benchmark](https://www.businesswaretech.com/blog/research-best-ai-services-for-automatic-invoice-processing)).

Where the picture gets messy is **handwriting and niche document types**. In one real-world test, **Textract reached only 71.2% on handwritten notes and Document AI 74.8%** — neither is great, and Mistral OCR 4 hasn't published a directly comparable handwriting number yet, so treat handwriting as "test it on your own docs" for all three. And for layout-heavy documents — multi-column legal filings, nested tables, charts — a purpose-built parser like [LlamaParse](https://www.llamaindex.ai/insights/best-ocr-api) is designed for semantic, layout-aware parsing rather than raw character recognition, and can beat all three general engines on that specific job. The takeaway: Mistral OCR 4 wins the *general-purpose multilingual* crown; the specialists still win their niches.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'What does each OCR API actually cost per page?',
            content: `This is where the spread stops being a rounding error and starts being a budget line. The numbers below are standard per-1,000-page rates; all of them have free tiers and volume discounts, so confirm against your region and document mix.

**Mistral OCR 4** is **$4 per 1,000 pages** on the standard API, **$2 per 1,000 in batch** (a 50% discount), and **$5 per 1,000** through the higher-level Document AI mode ([official pricing](https://mistral.ai/news/ocr-4/)). **AWS Textract** is the outlier: **$1.50 per 1,000 pages** for basic \`DetectDocumentText\`, but **$65 per 1,000 pages** the moment you turn on \`AnalyzeDocument\` forms-and-tables — the feature most real document work needs. **Google Document AI** ranges **$1.50 to $30 per 1,000** depending on processor, with form parsers and custom extractors at the top. **Azure Document Intelligence** sits around **$10 per 1,000** for prebuilt models ([AI:PRODUCTIVITY breakdown](https://aiproductivity.ai/blog/document-ai-cost-comparison/)).

Put it in dollars. Processing **50,000 invoices a month** on Textract's forms pricing costs about **$3,250/month** ($65 × 50). The same volume on Mistral OCR 4 batch is **$100/month** ($2 × 50) — a **97% cut**. That single number is why cost-sensitive, high-volume pipelines are the clearest win for Mistral. The same logic drives a lot of my [LLM cost-cutting work](/en/notes/llm-context-compression-cut-token-costs-2026): the model is rarely the expensive part of a document pipeline — the per-page extraction tax, multiplied across millions of pages, is.`,

Read it honestly: Textract's $1.50 basic tier is cheapest *if you only need plain text and nothing else*, but the second you need forms and tables it becomes the most expensive option by far. Google Document AI wins on language breadth and degraded scans. Mistral OCR 4 wins on price-for-features, multilingual quality, and the only self-host option in the group.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'When should you skip Mistral OCR 4?',
            content: `An honest comparison has to say where the new thing loses, so here it is. Skip Mistral OCR 4 — or at least don't default to it — in four cases.

**One: you're deep in AWS or GCP.** Most AWS-native teams end up on Textract not because it's the best engine in a vacuum, but because it's the best engine *inside an AWS architecture* — IAM, S3 triggers, and the [Lending Analysis API](https://www.braincuber.com/blog/aws-textract-vs-google-document-ai-ocr-comparison) for US mortgage and W2 packets are glue you'd otherwise rebuild. Same logic for Document AI inside GCP. The OCR engine is rarely the bottleneck; the integration is.

**Two: handwriting-heavy workloads.** None of these engines are great at handwriting (Textract 71.2%, Document AI 74.8%), and OCR 4 hasn't published a comparable number. If your documents are handwritten forms, benchmark all of them on *your* data before committing.

**Three: you need a battle-tested SLA today.** OCR 4 is one day old as of this writing. Textract and Document AI have years of production hardening, established uptime SLAs, and known failure modes. For a regulated workload shipping this quarter, "released yesterday" is a real risk, not a feature.

**Four: layout-heavy semantic parsing.** For multi-column legal documents, nested tables, and charts where you need *structure* more than characters, a layout-aware parser like LlamaParse or a self-hosted model like [baidu's Unlimited-OCR](https://huggingface.co/baidu/Unlimited-OCR) (trending on Hugging Face this week) may beat a general OCR engine. Match the tool to the document, not the hype.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'How would I wire Mistral OCR 4 into a RAG pipeline in production?',
            content: `Here's the integration the README won't write for you — the wiring I'd actually ship, drawn from building document-heavy features for [myFinancial](/en/notes/razorpay-vs-stripe-india-mvp-2026) and client RAG systems.

**Ingestion path:** documents land in object storage, a queue worker calls \`mistral-ocr-latest\` in **batch mode** (half the price, and ingestion is rarely latency-sensitive), and the returned \`page.markdown\` flows straight into the chunker. Markdown output is the quiet win here — clean headings and tables mean your chunk boundaries respect document structure instead of slicing mid-table. That single property does more for RAG answer quality than swapping embedding models.

**The confidence gate is non-negotiable.** Every block under ~0.70 confidence gets routed to a review queue, never silently indexed. This is the failure mode I worry about most: an OCR error doesn't throw an exception, it produces *plausible wrong text*, and your RAG system will cheerfully cite it. The per-word confidence scores in OCR 4 are the first time you can build that gate without a second model.

**Keep a fallback provider behind a flag.** I'd wire OCR behind a thin interface with Mistral as the default and Document AI as the fallback for documents Mistral flags as low-confidence — Google's edge on degraded scans makes it a good safety net. And for any data-sovereignty client, the **self-hosted single container** is the headline feature: documents never leave their VPC, which is the kind of requirement that kills a Textract deal before it starts. If you're choosing a stack for a brand-new product, the same provider-agnostic-with-fallback pattern is what I bake into every [6-week MVP](/en/services/6-week-mvp) so a vendor price hike or outage is a config change, not a rewrite.`,
        },
        {
            heading: 'The bottom line: which OCR API should you pick in 2026?',
            content: `If you're starting fresh, are cost- or volume-sensitive, or process multilingual documents, **Mistral OCR 4 is the new default** — it leads OlmOCRBench (85.20), covers 170 languages, adds confidence scores you can actually gate on, and costs $2–$4 per 1,000 pages against Textract's $65 for the same forms work. If you're already living inside AWS or GCP, the ecosystem glue of Textract or Document AI usually outweighs the per-page savings. And if your documents are handwritten, layout-heavy, or headed for a regulated launch this quarter, benchmark on your own data and lean on the mature incumbents.

The deeper point: OCR is finally cheap enough and accurate enough that it should stop being the thing that caps your document-AI accuracy. The smart move isn't picking one engine forever — it's wiring the OCR layer behind an interface so you can swap providers as prices and benchmarks shift (and in 2026, they shift monthly). If you want a hand building a document-AI or RAG pipeline that won't fall over on the first weird PDF, that's exactly the kind of [founding-engineer work](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) I do — I've shipped the unglamorous extraction layer enough times to know where it breaks.`,
