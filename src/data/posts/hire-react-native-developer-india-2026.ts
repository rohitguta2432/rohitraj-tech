      content: `Hire a **founding engineer in India** for a React Native MVP shipped in 4–8 weeks at ₹6–9 lakh fixed — one person owns architecture through Play Store and App Store. Hire an **agency** only with ₹25L+ committed and a locked, signed scope; agencies optimise billable hours, not your launch date. Pick **Toptal/Arc freelancers** (₹3,500–₹6,000/hr) only for narrow add-ons — one screen, one integration, one bug — never as your first technical hire.

Skip React Native entirely if your app needs deep Bluetooth, AR, or 120fps animation. Most India MVPs do not need this.`,

If you are looking to hire a React Native developer in India in 2026, your three real options cost wildly different amounts and produce wildly different things. A founding engineer ships a complete cross-platform MVP — Android, iOS, backend wiring, store submission — in 4 to 8 weeks for a fixed ₹6 to ₹9 lakh. A Bangalore or Bengaluru agency quotes the same scope at ₹22 to ₹35 lakh, takes 14 to 18 weeks, and routes you through a project manager who has never written a line of code. A Toptal or Upwork freelancer charges ₹3,500 to ₹6,000 per hour and needs you to do the architecture yourself.

I have shipped React Native and React Native + Expo apps on all three models across the last three years — the [Sanatana app on Play Store](/en/notes/idea-to-play-store-sanatanapp-architecture) (founding engineer, 7 weeks), an [offline-first trip planner with WatermelonDB](/en/notes/build-offline-first-trip-planner-react-native-watermelondb) (founding engineer, 5 weeks), and one project where a client paid a Hyderabad agency ₹28L for 16 weeks of work I later rebuilt in 9 weeks for ₹7L. The agency app still does not have working offline sync. The numbers below are not theoretical.

This post is the cost breakdown I wish every founder had before signing a contract. Real rates from May 2026, real timelines, real failure modes per model. If you would rather skip the hiring loop and just talk to one engineer, a [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp) is exactly that — but read the comparison first.`,

      heading: 'The Real Cost Of A React Native MVP In India — 2026 Numbers',
      content: `For a standard 12-screen React Native MVP — auth, onboarding, 4–5 feature screens, payments, push notifications, offline cache, Play Store + App Store submission — here is what each model actually costs in May 2026.

| Model | Headline rate | Total cost (12-screen MVP) | Timeline | Who owns architecture |
|-------|----------------|-----------------------------|----------|------------------------|
| Founding engineer India | ₹1.5–2L per week fixed | ₹6L–9L | 4–8 weeks | The engineer |
| Bangalore/Bengaluru agency (mid) | ₹2,200–₹3,500 per dev-hour | ₹22L–35L | 14–18 weeks | A project manager |
| Top-tier India agency (Tata Elxsi tier) | ₹4,000–₹6,500 per dev-hour | ₹45L–70L | 16–24 weeks | A delivery lead |
| Toptal RN freelancer | ₹4,500–₹6,000 per hour | ₹8L–14L (if scoped tight) | 8–14 weeks + 2–3 week hiring loop | You |
| Upwork mid-tier RN freelancer | ₹1,200–₹2,500 per hour | ₹4L–7L | 10–16 weeks (high variance) | You, badly |
| US/UK freelancer (Toptal global) | $90–$160 per hour | ₹50L–80L | 8–12 weeks | They claim to, you re-do half |

A founding engineer charges roughly **3x to 4x less** than a mid-tier Bangalore agency for the same shipped scope. The reason is not labour arbitrage — it is overhead arbitrage. An agency dev-hour at ₹3,000 includes the project manager, the QA lead, the account manager, the office in Indiranagar, the bench cost of the senior dev who reviews PRs, and the 30–50% margin. Roughly ₹1,000 of that ₹3,000 reaches code. A founding engineer is a single person, no PM, no bench, no margin layer — almost the entire rate is engineering output.

The 2025 IT industry slowdown also reset rates. Mid-tier Bangalore agency rates dropped 18 to 22 percent between Jan 2024 and Mar 2026 because client demand cooled and benches got expensive. Toptal India rates dropped 12 to 15 percent. Founding-engineer rates barely moved because supply is the constraint, not demand — there are fewer than 800 engineers in India who have shipped 3+ production React Native apps end-to-end. Most "10 years RN experience" CVs are someone who maintained one screen for 9 of those years.`,

      heading: 'Founding Engineer vs Agency vs Freelance — What You Are Actually Buying',
      content: `Cost is not the only axis. What the three models produce is structurally different.

**A founding engineer ships a product.** One person makes every architectural decision — auth flow, state management, offline strategy, navigation library, build pipeline, store submission. There is no committee, no internal handover, no Slack channel with 6 unread threads. On the Sanatana app I shipped 47 commits in week one, including the Expo dev build, Firebase auth, and the first three feature screens. By week 7 it was on the Play Store. Total cost: ₹8.2L. The "Expo or bare workflow" decision was made and shipped in 90 minutes — an agency would have spent a week on a Confluence page about it.

**An agency ships a deliverable.** The contract specifies a list of screens, a wireframe, and a launch date. The agency optimises for hitting the contract, which is not the same as hitting the launch. Scope creep is the agency's profit centre, not yours — every "small change" after the SOW is a change-order at ₹3,000/hour. The Hyderabad project I later rebuilt had 47 change-orders across 16 weeks. The client paid ₹28L for ~70% of the original scope and a codebase the next agency refused to touch. The architecture choice (Redux + Saga + bare workflow + 4 different navigation libraries on different screens) was visible from the second day of the rebuild. No one person had owned it; six developers had each won a small architectural argument.

**A freelancer ships hours.** Toptal and Arc match you with a senior engineer at ₹4,500/hour who is genuinely good at React Native. What you do not get is architectural ownership. The freelancer assumes you (or your founding engineer, or your CTO) made the decisions. They will execute brilliantly on "build the orders screen with offline support" and they will not push back on "we picked Redux because the last freelancer said so" even when it is the wrong call for your app. Freelancers are excellent multipliers for an existing team and dangerous as a first hire.

The mistake I see weekly is hiring a freelancer first because the rate looks cheap, then six weeks in realising no one is making architectural calls, then panic-hiring an agency to "rescue" the project. By that point the React Native codebase has 4 different navigation libraries, 2 different state managers, and a build that breaks on every other CI run. Total cost: 2x what a founding engineer would have charged from day one, and 4 months behind.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Hidden Costs Nobody Quotes On Day One',
      content: `The headline rate is a quarter of the real cost. The other three quarters are:

**Hand-off and rework.** Agencies hand off a codebase no one on your side wrote. The next change costs a re-onboarding fee or a new contract. On the rebuild project, the client paid an additional ₹4.5L to a different agency just to add Apple Sign-In, because the original team had taken their internal CLI tools when the contract ended.

**Store submission and reject loops.** First-time App Store submissions eat 1–3 rejection cycles. A founding engineer who has shipped 5+ apps batches the obvious failures (encryption declaration, NSCameraUsageDescription, ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption) into submission one. An agency junior submits, gets rejected, escalates to a senior 2 days later, submits again. I watched one client lose 11 days to review on a 3-line plist fix.

**Expo vs bare workflow.** Expo SDK 51 covers 90% of MVPs in 2026 with EAS Build, OTA updates, and config plugins. A founding engineer picks Expo by default and only ejects on a hard requirement (CallKit, custom signing, deep BLE). An agency picks bare workflow because their seniors learned RN in the 0.55 era. The bare-workflow tax: ~3 extra weeks of infra work, 2x CI cost, and 100% of the OTA logic you now build yourself.

**Backend integration.** Every quote silently assumes a backend exists. If it does not, the agency adds ₹8–12L for "backend integration support." A founding engineer who can ship a [Spring Boot or Node backend](/en/notes/spring-boot-vs-nodejs-startup-backend-2026) themselves saves the entire tax — why ~60% of my engagements are "RN app + backend + deploy" as one fixed scope.

**v1.1 and retainer.** After v1, an agency needs a new SOW. A freelancer is gone. A founding engineer takes a retainer (₹40–80K/month for 1 day a week) — what most MVPs actually need post-launch. Two of my last three clients converted.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Side-By-Side — What You Actually Get For ₹8L vs ₹28L',
      content: `Same 12-screen RN MVP, three models, real outcomes from 2025–2026 projects.

| Outcome | Founding engineer (₹8L, 7 wk) | Agency (₹28L, 16 wk) | Toptal freelancer (₹11L, 10 wk) |
|---------|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Codebase shipped | Yes | Yes (70% of scope) | Yes |
| Single architectural owner | Yes — same engineer through launch | No — 6 devs, PM, QA lead | You |
| Store submission included | Yes — both Play + App Store | Extra ₹1.5L line item | Out of scope |
| Backend wired | Yes — Spring Boot or Node | Add ₹8L line item | Out of scope |
| OTA update pipeline | Expo EAS Update day one | Not configured | Optional, ₹40K extra |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions + EAS Build | Jenkins (their server, you lose it on contract end) | Whatever you set up |
| Offline support | WatermelonDB or SQLite, designed in | "If client requests as change order" | If you specify |
| Post-launch retainer | ₹40–80K/mo, same engineer | New SOW, 6-week onboarding | Engineer disappears |
| Codebase you can hand to anyone | Yes — boring stack, documented | No — bespoke, 3 framework choices, no docs | Yes if scoped, no if not |
| Real 2026 timeline | 4–8 weeks | 14–18 weeks | 8–14 weeks + 2–3 wk hiring |
| All-in cost incl. fixes + v1.1 | ₹10–12L | ₹38–48L | ₹14–18L |

The ₹8L founding-engineer column does more on most rows. The ₹28L agency column wins on exactly one thing: it has more people, so if the lead developer is hit by a bus, the project survives. That bus-factor argument is the only honest pro-agency case. For most founders pre-Series-A, that risk is worth ₹20L of saved cash and 8 weeks of saved calendar.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'When The Agency Actually Wins (The Honest Counter-Case)',
      content: `I am not anti-agency. There are three concrete situations where a Bangalore or Bengaluru agency is the right call and a founding engineer is the wrong one.

**First, regulated industries with a compliance moat.** If you are building for healthcare with HIPAA + DISHA exposure, regulated fintech with RBI sandbox requirements, or anything that needs ISO 27001 + SOC 2 from day one, hire an agency that already has those certifications. A founding engineer can write secure code; they cannot give you a SOC 2 letter on day one. The cost premium buys the audit trail.

**Second, multi-platform scope larger than one person can hold.** If you genuinely need React Native + native iOS + native Android + a web admin + a backoffice tool + a public marketing site all shipping in parallel, one founding engineer is the wrong shape. You need 4–6 engineers and a coordinator. That is an agency. Most "we need all this" lists in pitch decks are aspirations — but if your investors have actually funded the parallel build, a founding engineer will become the bottleneck by week 3.

**Third, the founder cannot or will not be technical.** A founding engineer requires you to make decisions weekly — feature priority, scope cuts, store submission timing. If your founding team has zero technical reviewer and no time to sit in 2 weekly architecture calls, an agency PM is exactly what you need. The PM costs ₹3L of overhead per quarter, which is a small price for "I do not have to think about this." This is a legitimate trade-off, not a failure mode.

For every other case — pre-PMF, fixed budget, fast launch, India market, founding team that wants to ship — the founding-engineer model is structurally better. Compare this honestly to the [founding engineer vs fractional CTO](/en/notes/founding-engineer-vs-fractional-cto) trade-off if you also need part-time tech leadership without the full engineering build.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Decision Tree — Which Hiring Model In 5 Steps',
      content: `Run this in order. Stop at the first "yes" — that is your answer.

1. **Is your scope locked, signed, and unlikely to change in the next 4 months, AND do you have ₹25L+ committed?** → Hire an agency. The cost premium buys you team redundancy and you can afford it. (Note: if you answered yes to "scope is locked" on an unlaunched product, you are probably wrong — but at this budget you can afford to be.)

2. **Do you need a SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / RBI-sandbox audit letter at launch?** → Hire an agency that already holds the certification. A founding engineer cannot manufacture compliance paperwork.

3. **Do you need 4+ engineers shipping in parallel because the scope cannot collapse to one person?** → Hire an agency, or build the team in-house. A founding engineer is the wrong shape.

4. **Do you have 4 to 10 weeks, ₹6 to ₹12 lakh, and a founder who can sit in 2 weekly calls?** → Hire a founding engineer. This is the 80% case for India MVPs in 2026.

5. **Do you already have a founding engineer or CTO making architectural calls, and need to ship one specific feature (one screen, one integration, one bug)?** → Hire a Toptal or Arc freelancer at ₹4,500/hr. Do not hire a freelancer as your first technical hire — you do not yet know what to scope.

The single most predictive question is step 4. If you answered yes, you do not need to read more agency pitch decks. The reason most founders end up at an agency anyway is not that the agency is better — it is that the agency has a sales team and the founding engineer does not. The cost of that asymmetry is roughly ₹20 lakh per project.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Where To Go From Here',
      content: `If you have read this far, you have probably already decided. Three concrete next steps based on the model you picked.

If you picked founding engineer: a [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp) is the fixed-scope version — 8–12 screens, Expo or bare, backend wired, both stores in 6 weeks at a fixed price. For ongoing work, [hire a founding engineer in India](/en/services/hire-founding-engineer-india) on retainer.

If you picked freelancer: shortlist 3 from Toptal or Arc, ask each to write a 1-page architecture doc for your specific app before signing. The doc is worth ₹15K of their time and tells you more than 4 hours of interviews.

If you picked agency: ask for code samples from 3 past projects, not case studies. Read the commits, not the screenshots. Require that the actual lead engineer be on the kickoff call. The biggest agency-failure pattern is bait-and-switch — sold by the senior, built by a 2-year junior.

Whichever path: never pay more than 30% upfront on fixed-price, never sign a SOW longer than 8 weeks without milestone gates, and require the contract to specify that source code, design files, and CI configuration are yours on day one — not on final payment. Half the rescue projects I see start with "the agency is holding our code hostage."`,
