Building a multi-language React Native app with Expo SDK 52 requires separating UI i18n (using react-i18next for ~80 string keys) from content i18n (inline translations embedded directly in JSON data files). This approach, combined with bundled JSON for offline text and expo-av for streamed audio, lets you ship a 5-language app under 15MB with zero backend costs and full offline support on day one.

My grandmother recited Hanuman Chalisa every morning. When I wanted that same experience on my phone, I downloaded 5 different apps — one for Chalisa, one for Gita, one for Aarti, one for Ramayan audio. Each was ad-heavy, single-purpose, and 40-80MB.

The engineering challenge: build **one app** that replaces all of them — with 5 languages (Hindi, English, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu), offline text, streamed audio, and a ~15MB APK. No backend. No login. Privacy-first.

This post covers the architecture decisions, content strategy, and i18n approach I used to ship SanatanApp to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sanatandevotional.app).`

      heading: 'Why Choose JSON Over APIs for Content Architecture?',
      content: `The first decision was how to store sacred texts. Options:

1. **Remote API** — Flexible but requires internet, adds latency, needs a backend
2. **SQLite** — Overkill for read-only text, adds query overhead
3. **Bundled JSON** — Zero latency, works offline, trivially simple

I went with bundled JSON. The entire Hanuman Chalisa (40 verses × 5 languages) is ~12KB. Bhagavad Gita (700 verses × 5 languages) is ~180KB. All Aartis combined: ~25KB. Total text payload: **under 250KB**.

\`\`\`text
content/
├── texts/
│   ├── hanuman-chalisa.json    # { verses: [{ id, sanskrit, hindi, english }] }
│   ├── bhagavad-gita/
│   │   ├── chapter-01.json
│   │   └── ...chapter-18.json
│   └── aartis/
│       └── om-jai-jagdish.json
├── audio-sources.json          # Stream URLs (Archive.org, public domain)
└── i18n/
  ├── en.json                 # UI strings only
  └── hi.json
\`\`\`

The key insight: **separate content i18n from UI i18n**. Verse translations are embedded in each JSON file (one object per verse with all language fields). UI strings (buttons, labels, navigation) use \`react-i18next\`. This avoids the complexity of loading separate translation files for content.

One additional benefit of this structure is **incremental content updates**. When I later added Telugu translations, I only needed to add a \`telugu\` field to each verse object in the existing JSON files. No code changes, no new translation files, no changes to the i18n configuration. The VerseBlock component already had a fallback chain, so Telugu appeared automatically in the language picker once the data was present. For apps with large content corpuses across multiple languages, this architecture scales far better than routing everything through a traditional i18n library.`
    },
    {
      heading: 'How Should You Handle i18n for Content-Heavy Apps?',
      content: `Most i18n tutorials assume all translated content goes through the i18n system. For SanatanApp, that would mean 700 Gita verses × 5 languages = 3,500 translation keys just for one scripture. Unmanageable.

Instead, each verse object carries its own translations:

\`\`\`json
{
"id": 1,
"sanskrit": "श्रीगुरु चरन सरोज रज...",
"hindi": "श्री गुरु के चरण कमलों की धूल से...",
"english": "Having cleansed the mirror of my mind...",
"transliteration": "Shree Guru Charan Saroj Raj..."
}
\`\`\`

The VerseBlock component just reads the current language from context and renders the right field:

\`\`\`typescript
const { language } = useTranslation();
const text = verse[language] || verse.hindi; // Fallback to Hindi
\`\`\`

\`react-i18next\` handles only UI strings — about 80 keys total. This keeps the i18n system fast and the content pipeline simple. Adding a new language means adding one field to each verse JSON, not touching any code.`
    },
    {
      heading: 'Audio Streaming with expo-av',
      content: `Text is bundled. Audio is streamed. The Ramcharitmanas full katha is hours of audio — bundling it would make the APK 500MB+. Instead, I map content IDs to public domain streaming URLs in a single \`audio-sources.json\`:

\`\`\`json
{
"ramayan-bal-kand": {
  "title": "Bal Kand",
  "sourceUrl": "https://archive.org/download/...",
  "duration": 3600,
  "category": "ramayan"
}
}
\`\`\`

The AudioContext provider manages global playback state:

\`\`\`typescript
// Simplified AudioContext
const AudioContext = createContext<{
currentTrack: Track | null;
isPlaying: boolean;
play: (track: Track) => Promise<void>;
pause: () => void;
position: number;
}>({...});
\`\`\`

Key decisions:
- **No download/offline audio in v1** — keeps APK small, avoids storage management complexity
- **Background playback enabled** — users want to listen during commute or cooking
- **MiniPlayer pinned to bottom** — persistent audio bar across all screens, similar to Spotify
- **Archive.org as primary source** — public domain, no licensing issues, reliable CDN`
    },
    {
      heading: 'Local State: expo-sqlite for Progress & Streaks',
      content: `No backend means all user state lives on-device. I use \`expo-sqlite\` for three things:

1. **Bookmarks/Favorites** — Save any verse or aarti
2. **Reading progress** — Remember where you left off in each scripture
3. **Daily sadhana streaks** — Track consecutive days of practice

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE favorites (
id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
content_type TEXT,  -- 'verse' | 'aarti' | 'chapter'
content_id TEXT,
created_at INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE progress (
content_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
position INTEGER,     -- verse number or audio seconds
total INTEGER,
updated_at INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE sadhana (
date TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- 'YYYY-MM-DD'
tasks_json TEXT          -- ["morning_meditation", "gita_reading"]
);
\`\`\`

The streak calculation is a simple SQL query that counts consecutive dates backward from today. No cloud sync, no accounts, no privacy concerns.`

    {
      heading: 'How Did I Keep the APK Under 15MB?',
      content: `Most competing apps are 50-85MB. SanatanApp ships at ~15MB. Here's how:

| Component | Size | Strategy |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Text content (all scriptures) | ~250KB | Bundled JSON, no images |
| App code (JS bundle) | ~2MB | Tree-shaking, no heavy UI libs |
| Fonts (Noto Sans Devanagari) | ~1.5MB | Single weight, subset |
| Expo runtime | ~10MB | Managed workflow, minimal plugins |
| Audio | 0 | Streamed, not bundled |
| Images | ~500KB | Minimal — icons only, no hero images |

Key trade-offs:
- **No images for scriptures** — text-only with beautiful typography is actually more readable
- **Single font weight** — Regular only, no Bold/Italic variants of Devanagari font
- **Minimal dependencies** — React Navigation, expo-av, expo-sqlite, react-i18next. That's it.
- **No analytics SDK** — saves ~2MB and aligns with privacy-first positioning`

    {
      heading: 'What I Would Do Differently',
      content: `**Ship faster.** I spent too long on the design spec before writing code. The verse reader screen alone went through 4 design iterations. In hindsight, the first version was 80% right.

**Start with one scripture.** Bundling everything (Chalisa + Gita + Aartis + Ramayan) for v1 was ambitious. Launching with just Hanuman Chalisa would have been a faster path to user feedback.

**Consider Expo Router over React Navigation.** Expo Router (file-based routing) is more idiomatic in the Expo ecosystem now. I went with React Navigation because I knew it well, but Expo Router would have simplified the navigation setup.

The app is live on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sanatandevotional.app). If you're building a content-heavy React Native app with offline-first requirements, the JSON + streaming architecture works well. The total cost of running SanatanApp is $0/month — no servers, no databases, no CDN bills.

For founders reading this and wondering about delivery, the two ways I work are a [mobile app development](/en/services/mobile-app-development) and a [6-week MVP sprint](/en/services/6-week-mvp).

I've written the deeper version of this argument in [Streaming Audio in React Native: expo-av with Public Domain Sources](/en/notes/expo-av-audio-streaming-react-native) and the contrarian counter-take in [Building an Offline-First Trip Planner with React Native + WatermelonDB +…](/en/notes/build-offline-first-trip-planner-react-native-watermelondb).`

    {
      heading: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
      content: `**Q: How do you handle right-to-left (RTL) languages in React Native with Expo?**

React Native has built-in RTL support through the I18nManager API. You call \`I18nManager.forceRTL(true)\` when the user selects an RTL language, and React Native automatically mirrors flexbox layouts, padding, and margins. For SanatanApp, all five languages (Hindi, English, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu) are left-to-right, so RTL was not needed. However, if you plan to add Urdu or Arabic support, you should design your layout components with RTL in mind from the start to avoid painful refactoring later.

**Q: Why use bundled JSON instead of a CMS or headless API for content?**

Bundled JSON eliminates network dependency entirely, which is critical for apps used in areas with poor connectivity. The entire Bhagavad Gita across 5 languages is only ~180KB — trivial compared to a single hero image. A CMS adds latency, requires a backend, introduces a monthly hosting cost, and creates a single point of failure. For read-only content that changes infrequently (sacred texts don't get updated), bundled JSON is the simplest, fastest, and cheapest architecture. You update content by shipping an app update through the Play Store.

**Q: How does expo-av handle audio buffering and network interruptions during streaming?**

expo-av handles buffering automatically through its internal player. When the network is slow, the player buffers ahead and pauses playback if the buffer runs empty, resuming automatically when enough data is available. For SanatanApp, I save playback position to SQLite every 5 seconds, so if a network interruption forces the user to restart, they resume from their last saved position rather than the beginning. For production apps, you should also implement retry logic and show a buffering indicator in the MiniPlayer UI.

**Q: What is the best way to add a new language to a React Native app built this way?**

Adding a new language involves two steps. First, add a new field to each verse object in your content JSON files (e.g., add a \`tamil\` field alongside \`hindi\` and \`english\`). Second, add the language option to your react-i18next configuration and translate the ~80 UI string keys. No component code changes are needed because the VerseBlock component dynamically reads the field matching the current language from context. The entire process for SanatanApp took about 2 days per language, mostly spent on translation quality review.

**Q: Can this architecture support user-generated content or social features?**

Not without adding a backend. The zero-cost architecture (bundled JSON, no server, no database) is specifically designed for read-only content apps. If you want user comments, community features, or shared bookmarks, you would need to introduce a backend service like Supabase or Firebase, which adds monthly costs and authentication complexity. My recommendation is to ship v1 without social features, validate user demand, and add a backend only when user feedback confirms it is needed.`
